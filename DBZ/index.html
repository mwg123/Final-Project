    <p>I remember seeing a few bits of "Dragonball Z" on TV growing up and thinking
    it was extremely stupid.  So why did I spend more money than usual to see a 
    spin-off movie of the show in the theater?  I'm not sure, really.  A chance to
    dish out some bile? Or perhaps to see if, now that I've seen some good anime (like "Inuyasha" or anything)
    by Hayao Miyazaki, it wasn't as bad as I remember (the latter is why I subjected myself
    to watching "The Royal Tenenbaums" a second time).  If nothing else, it could give me another entry for 
    my Bottom 10 list this year.</p>

    <p>So what's the verdict?  Look at the rating and take a guess.</p>

    <p>"Dragonball Z: Resurrection "F" is for fans only.  Anyone who hasn't grown to love
    the characters while watching the show will find little of any interest here.  Granted,
    "Inuyasha: Affections Touching Across Time" wasn't the most friendly to people who weren't
    already fans of the show, but it at least gave a perfunctory set-up.  That doesn't happen
    here, where there is no set-up or character development whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Megalomaniac Frieza (Ayres) has just been resurrected by his second-in-command 
    Sorbet (Schwartz).  Item number one on his agenda is getting revenge on Goku (Schemmel),
    the Earthling who destroyed him.  Despite Sorbet's attempts to convince him that there 
    are far more opportunities to expand his empire if he leaves Goku alone, Frieza won't be
    dissuaded.  So after he trains himself (for the first time, I might add), he heads to the
    planet of the humans.  Unfortunately, his nemesis is off planet in a training session of
    his own.  So Freiza amuses himself by destroying a city and having his minions attack
    Goku's friends.  Then Goku and his brother/rival/partner/something Gohan show up, and the
    real fight begins.</p>

    <p>That's essentially it for the plot.  I assume the appeal for fans is the same for "The Avengers:"
    Seeing all your favorite characters in one movie team up for a massive smackdown.  Unfortunately,
    the action scenes are so basic (in choreography and method) that there's almost no tension.  Flying
    through the trees and shooting balls of light at each other would be tough for even James Cameron 
    to make exciting, and director Tadayoshi Yamamuro is <em>definitely</em> no James Cameron.</p>

    <p>The fight between Goku and Frieza, which takes up the latter half of the film, is equally lifeless.
    One of the reasons why the show sucked is that their moves were so repetitive and basic. I don't know
    about you, but watching two guys with obvious steroid problems become living fireworks and shooting balls
    of light at each other isn't especially cinematic.  Especially if they scream like they are heavily
    constipated and trying to use the bathroom.  Even worse, shots are poorly framed and the choreography is
    painfully basic.</p>

    <p>As for the voice acting...well, it's no better.  Every voice actor is terrible; they sound obnoxious
    and annoying and speak dialogue that is trite and stupid.  I'll freely admit that good dialogue in "Inuyasha"
    is pretty rare, but at least the actors are talented enough to speak with conviction and appeal.</p>

    <p>"Dragonball Z: Resurrection F" is just as lame as the TV show.  But what is really sad is that it was
    well-marketed and got a lot of fans.  Everyone else saw it for what it was: a piece of crap.  Unlike the
    best anime, it doesn't stimulate the mind or touch the heart.  It's just senseless, mind-rotting noise
    that cost the genre a lot of fans.  The best the film can come up with is a few mildly amusing jokes, most
    of which would be considered lame for an afternoon sitcom.</p>

    <p>If you were like me and had a bias against anime from this show, please, don't give up on it.  Movies like
    "Spirited Away" and "Grave of the Fireflies" entertain in ways no traditional film ever could, animated or
    otherwise.  And if you're a "Dragonball Z" fan, see these other films to see how low you've set the bar.</p>
