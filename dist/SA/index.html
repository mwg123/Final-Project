    <p>I love this movie.  I love it with all my heart.  "Spirited Away,"
    written and directed by master storyteller Hayao Miyazaki, is a true
    masterpiece.  Not only is it the finest animated film ever made, it is
    one of the finest animated films ever made period.  It deserves a place
    alongside "The Godfather," "Schindler's List," and "Casablanca."  Visually
    dazzling, emotionally complex and splendidly told, this is truly a movie for
    all to enjoy.</p>

    <p>Chihiro (Chase) is a whiny brat who is upset that she's having to move to
    the middle of nowhere with her parents (voiced by Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis).
    On the way there, they get sidetracked and end up in an abandoned theme park...or so
    they think.  Chihiro's parents begin to chow down on delicious food (that they'll pay
    for later), but they end up turning into pigs.  Now Chihiro is trapped in the world of
    the gods and forced to work in a bathouse run by the vicious Yubaba (Pleshette).  Her
    allies are few, and she has to remember who she is if she is to rescue her parents
    return to our world.</p>

    All his films are wildly imaginative, but none moreso than "Spirited Away."  This is a
    truly beautiful film that would be worth watching on mute.  Miyazaki fills the screen with
    wonderful and bizarre creatures that capture the eye as well as the mind.  From the three
    bouncing heads in Yubaba's office to the mysterious Noh-Face that lurks in the background,
    there is never a dull moment for they eyes.  In fact, this whole world, particularly the 
    bathhouse, begs "Explore Me!"<p></p>

    <p>The second thing one notices is the complexity of the story.  Disney movies, even the
    best ones, are constrained by formulas.  That doesn't happen here.  There's no telling
    where this story is going to go.  Miyazaki carefully lets it unfold as Chihiro sees it.
    We don't know any more about this strange place than she does.  The story also plays by
    different rules than most American films.  The themes of identity and transformation
    (people are rarely who they seem, in a both literal and figurative sense) are, as told by
    Miyazaki, different than what we're used to.  Yet, at its heart, this is really a coming of
    age story.</p>

    <p>The voice acting is fantastic.  Daveigh Chase is terrific as Chihiro.  This is a girl we
    can all get behind and root for.  Chase, who famously played Samara in "The Ring," has a
    tendency to get shrill when she screams, but those moments are few.  Jason Marsden, a popular
    Disney voice actor, is positively perfect as Haku, the mysterious boy who may or may not be
    helping Chihiro.  His voice is soothing and seductive, and Miyazaki draws him in such a way
    that is both threatening and romantic.  Susan Egan, also a good voice actress, is terrific as
    Lin, Chihiro's feisty freind.  The late great Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film appearance) 
    is suitably menacing as the boss who controlls her workers by stealing their names.  At the very
    least, no one can claim that Yubaba isn't an original villain.  And yet, Pleshette gives the character
    some humanity, mainly by having her dote on her giant baby (Strong).</p>

    <p>While Kirk Wise may have directed the English speaking voice actors (and added a few lines), this is
    all Miyazaki.  It has all his trademarks: vivid images, characters that touch the heart and a strong
    storytelling ability.  But more important is the feel of the film.  Miyazaki is a master of tone; all his
    films have a sense of magical whimsy that only he can create.  The wonderful musical score by Joe Hisaishi
    (who always scores Miyazaki's films), is beautiful and evocative without feeling overly manipulative.</p>

    <p>"Spirited Away" is a true masterpiece and while it achieved immense critical and overseas success (it
    outgroosed "Titanic" to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history), it's still a cult movie in 
    many respects.  That's a shame, because anyone who watches it will see it for what it is: a one of a kind
    moviegoing experience.</p>
