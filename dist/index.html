            <p>People frequently ask me what my favorite movie is.  For the
            longest time, I couldn't answer.  How can I choose one from the
            hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen?  Sure,
            I've loved many films, but is it possible to shoose an absolute
            favorite?  Then I realized that the answer was right in front
            of me.  "Brotherhood of the Wolf" literally has everything.  A
            great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action, likable characters that
            are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous
            sex and nudity.  This admission isn't going to make me popular with 
            the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest sense of the word, it's
            a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the
            surface.  But as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.</p>
        
            <p>France, 1764.  In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast
            has been terrorizing the populace by maiming and killing women and children.
            It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace.  News of 
            monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it.
            One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with
            a biting wit.  The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood brother.
            Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be
            studied.  Of course, when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it
            seems.</p>
            </div>

                <img id="fronsacAndThomas" src="http://ricedawg.phpwebhosting.com/riceworld/reviews_movies/BOTW/jeremie_renier5.jpg" alt="Fronsac and Thomas">
            <p>Everything about this movie is first-rate.  The acting is excellent,
            the action scenes are directed with flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere.
            What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable.  While it's true
            that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where
            the film takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this
            movie the label of "based on a true story" is about the same as saying that "Stargate"
            is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.</p>    
        
            <p>Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly.  In addition to his
            occupations, he's a libertine with a wicked wit.  All of these qualites are shown
            in the film.  It doesn't take him long to realize that there's more than meets
            the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results
            in astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way.  His 
            wit is also razor sharp; some of his antics are hilarious.  Mark Dacascos doesn't
            say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in the action scenes.  He also
            shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible French.</p>

            <p>The characters they meet in Gevudan are no less interesting.  There's Marianne
            (Dequenne), the daughter of a local aristocrat with whom Fronsac begins to
            woo (the scene where he introduces himself to her is hilarious).  Not only is
            she beautiful, but le Bihan and Dequenne have smoldering chemistry together, both as
            actors and as characters.  Marianne is a feisty girl, and she's not going to let just
            any man sweep her off her feet.  Jeremie Renier is also very good as Thomas d'Apcher,
            another young aristocrat who follows Fronsac around like a groupie.</p>
        
            <p>The two most well-known actors on this side of the Atlantic, Vincent Cassel
            and Monica Bellucci (who were at one point married in real life), are just as
            good as their co-stars.  Cassel plays Marianne's brother Jean-Francois, who
            lost his arm a few years prior in Africa.  Cassel is at his weird best, playing
            the character with both sympathy and mystery.  Bellucci has what is arguably the
            juciest part; she plays Sylvia, the prostitute who has an affinity for the strange
            and who may know more about what is going on than anyone.</p>
        
            <p>Christophe Gans deserves as much credit for the film's success as his stars.  Stylishly
            directed and containing more atmosphere than any movie in the past 20 years,
            Gans's work is truly incredible.  In addition to being able to sufficiently flesh out his
            characters within the contezxt of what is really an action movie (something that has eclipsed many
            filmmakers), he is also adept at sleight-of-hand.  There's no possible way to predict what happens
            further along down the road.  A person may be able to predict the "whodunit," but not why or how.
            At two-and-a-half hours, this is a fairly lengthy motion picture.  It doesn't feel like it, however.</p>

            <p>"Brotherhood of the Wolf" has the capacity to absorb from frame one, and it sticks with you long
            after the film is over.  I have watched this film many, many times, and it gets better with each
            successive viewing.  There aren't many movies that can make that claim.</p>
            <p><id="About">About the Director's Cut: The film has become something of a cult classic over the years
            (according to Wikipedia, it grossed $11 million over here), which is great, although i have to 
            admit that it's kind of sad that people are so against subtitles and foreign films.  To be quite
            honest, there is nothing here for the arthouse crowd.  Substitue in known actors and have them
            speak English, and it would be a monster hit at the box office.</id="About"></p>
        
            <p>The director's cut containst about ten minutes of extra footage, give or take.  Some of it is just
            minute extensions of some sequences, but there are two full scenes added in (although I believe a line
            from a voiceover has been eliminated for some reason).  I was wondering how a filmmaker could improve
            upon a film that, in my mind, is as close to perfect as possible?  It turns out that you can't.  The 
            extra scenes are really unnecessary and don't add much that we don't already know.  They only serve to
            pad out the running time and cause the carefully built momentum to drag.  Ironically, some of the deleted
            scenes that Gans talks about in the Extra Features are the ones that should have been left in, rather than
            the ones he actually put back into the film.  The theatrical cut gets a perfect score, but because of the 
            poor decisions he made, the Director's Cut slips to a three-and-a-half.</p>
