    <p>From its very inception, "The Devil's Own" was in deep water.  Current events and other factors
    demanded rewrites (including filming without a finished script), much to the displeasure of star
    Brad Pitt, who called it "a disaster" and "the most irresponsible piece of filimmaking" (Pitt
    wanted to back out, but doing so would have cost him "$63 million for starters").  It was originally
    going to be released for Oscar attention, but test audiences hated it, so it was pushed back to a March
    release date.</p>

    <p>While such drama is normally a really bad sign, "The Devil's Own" manages to rise above it and come 
    out as a decent flick.  It's by no means perfect, but for what it is, it's entertaining.</p>

    <p>Frankie Maguire (Pitt) is a notorious IRA terrorist known as Frankie the Angel.  Wanted for dozens of
    murders, Frankie barely escapes with his life after the British try to take him down (killing a number of
    his friends in the process).  Frankie is sent to the US to pick up some stinger missiles, believing that to
    be the only way of getting the British government's attention.  Now known as Rory Devaney, he is staying at
    the home of an IRA sympathizer's friend, a cop named Tom O'Meara (Ford).  But the past doesn't stay buried
    forever, and Frankie's true purpose for being in New York is bound to catch up with him.</p>

    <p>Despite all its problems, the film is strongly acted.  Ford and Pitt, two consistently good actors, do solid
    work.  It's not Oscar-worthy material from either of them, but they do their jobs.  Ford is his usual reliable self
    playing a good, moral cop facing a number of difficult choices.  Pitt manages to get us on his side despite the fact
    he is a terrorist capable of brutal acts of violence.  Ruben Blades provides solid support as Tom's partner, although
    his story is almost superfluous (it's meant to give the film color and allow the audience to understand Tom's motivations
    for the final act, but it doesn't really work).  Treat Williams turns up the nasty as a gunrunner, and Natasha McElhone
    is good as Frankie's contact/love interest.</p>

    <p>This was the final film of Alan J. Pakula, a director of some repute (he was killed in a car accident shortly after the
    film was finished).  It's solidly told, but there are a few concerns I have about the film.  First the film makes no mention
    of the Troubles.  The backdrop is generic; substitute any conflict in its place and almost nothing would change.  Not only
    is this a little insulting to those who were affected by the conflict, it robs the film of a lot of texture and possible conflict.
    Second, Pakula uses a light jaunty tune over a montage of Frankie and his friend Sean (Ronan) preparing their boat to take the
    missiles back to Ireland.  It's a little disconcerting, especially after 9/11.  Finally, the film is a little too violent for its own
    good.  With a darker tone and more weight to the script (apparently this was the case for the original script that Pitt signed on to make,
    but rewrites diluted it), the brutality would have been appropriate.  As it is, it comes across as excessive.</p>

    <p>Watching this movie, I couldn't help wishing it was more.  With a stronger, richer script and characters who exhibited more
    dimensions, this could have been the film it deserved to be.  It raises a lot of interesting questions.  Questions like, is terrorism ever
    justified (which "Munich" asked nearly a decade later)?  How does witnessing or committing acts of violence affect a person?  How
    does the act of arresting or possibly killing a man affect you if you know and love the person?  Compelling questions to be sure,
    but unfortunately there's no follow through.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a good thriller, this is an okay choice.  I liked it.  I was entertained.  But I kept seeing the film that it
    could have been.  If only...</p>
