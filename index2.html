            <p>People frequently ask me what my favorite movie is. For the longest time, I couldn't answer. How can I
              choose one from the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen? Sure, I've loved many films,
              but is it possible to shoose an absolute favorite? Then I realized that the answer was right in front of
              me. "Brotherhood of the Wolf" literally has everything. A great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action,
              likable characters that are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous sex and
              nudity. This admission isn't going to make me popular with the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest
              sense of the word, it's a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the surface. But
              as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.</p>
            <p>France, 1764. In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast has been terrorizing the populace by
              maiming and killing women and children. It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace. News of
              monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it. One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le
              Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with a biting wit. The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood
              brother. Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be studied. Of course,
              when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it seems.</p>
          </div>

              alt="Fronsac and Thomas">
            <p>Everything about this movie is first-rate. The acting is excellent, the action scenes are directed with
              flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere. What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable.
              While it's true that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where the film
              takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this movie the label of "based on a
              true story" is about the same as saying that "Stargate" is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.</p>
            <p>Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly. In addition to his occupations, he's a libertine
              with a wicked wit. All of these qualites are shown in the film. It doesn't take him long to realize that
              there's more than meets the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results in
              astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way. His wit is also razor sharp; some
              of his antics are hilarious. Mark Dacascos doesn't say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in
              the action scenes. He also shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible
              French.</p>
          </div>

              alt="Fight Scene">
            <p>The characters they meet in Gevudan are no less interesting. There's Marianne (Dequenne), the daughter of
              a local aristocrat with whom Fronsac begins to woo (the scene where he introduces himself to her is
              hilarious). Not only is she beautiful, but le Bihan and Dequenne have smoldering chemistry together, both
              as actors and as characters. Marianne is a feisty girl, and she's not going to let just any man sweep her
              off her feet. Jeremie Renier is also very good as Thomas d'Apcher, another young aristocrat who follows
              Fronsac around like a groupie.</p>
            <p>The two most well-known actors on this side of the Atlantic, Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci (who were
              at one point married in real life), are just as good as their co-stars. Cassel plays Marianne's brother
              Jean-Francois, who lost his arm a few years prior in Africa. Cassel is at his weird best, playing the
              character with both sympathy and mystery. Bellucci has what is arguably the juciest part; she plays
              Sylvia, the prostitute who has an affinity for the strange and who may know more about what is going on
              than anyone.</p>
            <p>Christophe Gans deserves as much credit for the film's success as his stars. Stylishly directed and
              containing more atmosphere than any movie in the past 20 years, Gans's work is truly incredible. In
              addition to being able to sufficiently flesh out his characters within the contezxt of what is really an
              action movie (something that has eclipsed many filmmakers), he is also adept at sleight-of-hand. There's
              no possible way to predict what happens further along down the road. A person may be able to predict the
              "whodunit," but not why or how. At two-and-a-half hours, this is a fairly lengthy motion picture. It
              doesn't feel like it, however.</p>

            <p>"Brotherhood of the Wolf" has the capacity to absorb from frame one, and it sticks with you long after
              the film is over. I have watched this film many, many times, and it gets better with each successive
              viewing. There aren't many movies that can make that claim.</p>
            <p><i id="About">About the Director's Cut:</i> The film has become something of a cult classic over the
              years (according to Wikipedia, it grossed $11 million over here), which is great, although i have to admit
              that it's kind of sad that people are so against subtitles and foreign films. To be quite honest, there is
              nothing here for the arthouse crowd. Substitue in known actors and have them speak English, and it would
              be a monster hit at the box office.</p>
            <p>The director's cut containst about ten minutes of extra footage, give or take. Some of it is just minute
              extensions of some sequences, but there are two full scenes added in (although I believe a line from a
              voiceover has been eliminated for some reason). I was wondering how a filmmaker could improve upon a film
              that, in my mind, is as close to perfect as possible? It turns out that you can't. The extra scenes are
              really unnecessary and don't add much that we don't already know. They only serve to pad out the running
              time and cause the carefully built momentum to drag. Ironically, some of the deleted scenes that Gans
              talks about in the Extra Features are the ones that should have been left in, rather than the ones he
              actually put back into the film. The theatrical cut gets a perfect score, but because of the poor
              decisions he made, the Director's Cut slips to a three-and-a-half.</p>

            <p>I love this movie. I love it with all my heart. "Spirited Away,"
              written and directed by master storyteller Hayao Miyazaki, is a true
              masterpiece. Not only is it the finest animated film ever made, it is
              one of the finest animated films ever made period. It deserves a place
              alongside "The Godfather," "Schindler's List," and "Casablanca." Visually
              dazzling, emotionally complex and splendidly told, this is truly a movie for
              all to enjoy.</p>

              alt="Landscape">
            <p>Chihiro (Chase) is a whiny brat who is upset that she's having to move to
              the middle of nowhere with her parents (voiced by Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis).
              On the way there, they get sidetracked and end up in an abandoned theme park...or so
              they think. Chihiro's parents begin to chow down on delicious food (that they'll pay
              for later), but they end up turning into pigs. Now Chihiro is trapped in the world of
              the gods and forced to work in a bathouse run by the vicious Yubaba (Pleshette). Her
              allies are few, and she has to remember who she is if she is to rescue her parents
              return to our world.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            All his films are wildly imaginative, but none moreso than "Spirited Away." This is a
            truly beautiful film that would be worth watching on mute. Miyazaki fills the screen with
            wonderful and bizarre creatures that capture the eye as well as the mind. From the three
            bouncing heads in Yubaba's office to the mysterious Noh-Face that lurks in the background,
            there is never a dull moment for they eyes. In fact, this whole world, particularly the
            bathhouse, begs "Explore Me!"</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img id="yubaba"
              src="https://sweensryche.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/chihiro-yubaba-spirited-away-399712_953_516.jpg"
              alt="Yubaba">
            <p>The second thing one notices is the complexity of the story. Disney movies, even the
              best ones, are constrained by formulas. That doesn't happen here. There's no telling
              where this story is going to go. Miyazaki carefully lets it unfold as Chihiro sees it.
              We don't know any more about this strange place than she does. The story also plays by
              different rules than most American films. The themes of identity and transformation
              (people are rarely who they seem, in a both literal and figurative sense) are, as told by
              Miyazaki, different than what we're used to. Yet, at its heart, this is really a coming of
              age story.</p>

            <p>The voice acting is fantastic. Daveigh Chase is terrific as Chihiro. This is a girl we
              can all get behind and root for. Chase, who famously played Samara in "The Ring," has a
              tendency to get shrill when she screams, but those moments are few. Jason Marsden, a popular
              Disney voice actor, is positively perfect as Haku, the mysterious boy who may or may not be
              helping Chihiro. His voice is soothing and seductive, and Miyazaki draws him in such a way
              that is both threatening and romantic. Susan Egan, also a good voice actress, is terrific as
              Lin, Chihiro's feisty freind. The late great Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film appearance)
              is suitably menacing as the boss who controlls her workers by stealing their names. At the very
              least, no one can claim that Yubaba isn't an original villain. And yet, Pleshette gives the character
              some humanity, mainly by having her dote on her giant baby (Strong).</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>While Kirk Wise may have directed the English speaking voice actors (and added a few lines), this is
              all Miyazaki. It has all his trademarks: vivid images, characters that touch the heart and a strong
              storytelling ability. But more important is the feel of the film. Miyazaki is a master of tone; all his
              films have a sense of magical whimsy that only he can create. The wonderful musical score by Joe Hisaishi
              (who always scores Miyazaki's films), is beautiful and evocative without feeling overly manipulative.</p>

            <p>"Spirited Away" is a true masterpiece and while it achieved immense critical and overseas success (it
              outgroosed "Titanic" to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history), it's still a cult movie in
              many respects. That's a shame, because anyone who watches it will see it for what it is: a one of a kind
              moviegoing experience.</p>

              <p>I remember seeing a few bits of "Dragonball Z" on TV growing up and thinking
                it was extremely stupid. So why did I spend more money than usual to see a
                spin-off movie of the show in the theater? I'm not sure, really. A chance to
                dish out some bile? Or perhaps to see if, now that I've seen some good anime (like "Inuyasha" or
                anything)
                by Hayao Miyazaki, it wasn't as bad as I remember (the latter is why I subjected myself
                to watching "The Royal Tenenbaums" a second time). If nothing else, it could give me another entry for
                my Bottom 10 list this year.</p>

              <p>So what's the verdict? Look at the rating and take a guess.</p>

              <p>"Dragonball Z: Resurrection "F" is for fans only. Anyone who hasn't grown to love
                the characters while watching the show will find little of any interest here. Granted,
                "Inuyasha: Affections Touching Across Time" wasn't the most friendly to people who weren't
                already fans of the show, but it at least gave a perfunctory set-up. That doesn't happen
                here, where there is no set-up or character development whatsoever.</p>

                the Earthling who destroyed him. Despite Sorbet's attempts to convince him that there
                are far more opportunities to expand his empire if he leaves Goku alone, Frieza won't be
                dissuaded. So after he trains himself (for the first time, I might add), he heads to the

                his own. So Freiza amuses himself by destroying a city and having his minions attack

              <p>That's essentially it for the plot. I assume the appeal for fans is the same for "The Avengers:"
                Seeing all your favorite characters in one movie team up for a massive smackdown. Unfortunately,
                the action scenes are so basic (in choreography and method) that there's almost no tension. Flying
                through the trees and shooting balls of light at each other would be tough for even James Cameron
                to make exciting, and director Tadayoshi Yamamuro is <em>definitely</em> no James Cameron.</p>
              <p>The fight between Goku and Frieza, which takes up the latter half of the film, is equally lifeless.
                One of the reasons why the show sucked is that their moves were so repetitive and basic. I don't know
                about you, but watching two guys with obvious steroid problems become living fireworks and shooting
                balls
                of light at each other isn't especially cinematic. Especially if they scream like they are heavily
                constipated and trying to use the bathroom. Even worse, shots are poorly framed and the choreography is
                painfully basic.</p>

              <p>As for the voice acting...well, it's no better. Every voice actor is terrible; they sound obnoxious
                and annoying and speak dialogue that is trite and stupid. I'll freely admit that good dialogue in
                "Inuyasha"
                is pretty rare, but at least the actors are talented enough to speak with conviction and appeal.</p>

              <p>"Dragonball Z: Resurrection F" is just as lame as the TV show. But what is really sad is that it was
                well-marketed and got a lot of fans. Everyone else saw it for what it was: a piece of crap. Unlike the
                best anime, it doesn't stimulate the mind or touch the heart. It's just senseless, mind-rotting noise
                that cost the genre a lot of fans. The best the film can come up with is a few mildly amusing jokes,
                most
                of which would be considered lame for an afternoon sitcom.</p>

              <p>If you were like me and had a bias against anime from this show, please, don't give up on it. Movies
                like
                "Spirited Away" and "Grave of the Fireflies" entertain in ways no traditional film ever could, animated
                or
                otherwise. And if you're a "Dragonball Z" fan, see these other films to see how low you've set the bar.

                <p>A good caper will come up with an ingenious plot and call it a day. A great one will know that's not
                  enough. You have to come up with a plot that seems perfect, and then have it go wrong in ways you
                  don't
                  expect.
                  "Bound" fits into the latter category. That it has time for strong writing and acting makes it
                  something
                  of a
                  miracle.

                  alt="Violet and Corky">
                <p>Corky (Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who has just moved into a condo next to a sultry, raven-haired
                  beauty
                  named Violet (Tilly). Violet's lover is Caesar (Pantoliano), who launders money for the local mob. But
                  Violet
                  is unhappy, both sexually and personally, and when she sees Corky in the elevator, she sees hope for a
                  way out.
                  It just so happens that a local mob flunkie tried to abscond with $2 million plus, and the punishment
                  ended up
                  being a bloody mess. Caesar has been tasked with (literally) laundering the money. And there in lies
                  an
                  opportunity
                  for Corky and Violet to get away with the money and leave the weasel Caesar to take the fall for it.
                </p>

                <p>From an execution perspective, "Bound" is a near-brilliant piece of film noir. Corky's plan is
                  ingenious, but
                  that's just the set-up. Caesar is smart, and acts in ways that neither Corky nor Violet anticipate,
                  which leads to
                  a lot of tense moments and improvising. There were plenty of times where I had no idea what to expect.
                  Other times
                  I thought I knew what was going to happen but was proven wrong.</p>

              <div>
                <p>On a technical level, the film matches its plot. The Wachowski sisters, who at the time were still
                  male, have a sense of
                  visual flair (as they proved with their most famous, and successful, franchise, The Matrix"). They
                  know
                  that camera movement
                  and plot rhythm are essential in a movie like this, and some of their shots are stunning. The majority
                  of the film takes place
                  in two apartments, but they make this film into a claustrophobic yet still kinetic experience. The
                  sisters start out slow and
                  allow the tension to build. Far too many thrillers lack that confidence.</p>

                <p>For this movie to work, the actors have to sell their characters, and they do. Jennifer Tilly and
                  Gina
                  Gershon, both of whom
                  deserve far more fame than they get, are excellent in their roles. Tilly with her helium voice flouts
                  the dim-bulb girlfriend that
                  Violet initially appears to be. When she seduces Corky with enough speed and elegance to surprise us,
                  we
                  know that she's a force
                  to be reckoned with. For her part, Gershon also escapes the stereotype that she starts out as. Corky
                  may
                  be a bad to the bone butch
                  lesbian, but she's also smart and clever. The two women have a lot of chemistry with each other, so
                  much
                  so that their sex scene is red hot,
                  despite the fact that it happens only a few minutes after their first interaction together. Able
                  support
                  is provided by veteran character
                  actor Joe Pantoliano (whom the Wachowskis would infamously cast in "The Matrix") and Christopher
                  Meloni.
                  Meloni, best known for playing
                  Det. Elliot Stabler on "Law and Order: SVU," is an interesting case. He's quite good as the psychotic
                  son of the Don. His background
                  is mainly in comedy, and he has little trouble tweaking it for a menacing effect.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>One thing I appreciated is that even in 1996, the Wachowski sisters refuse to make the fact that the
                  two lead characters are lesbians
                  into any sort of a big deal. Many films that deal with LGBT characters, even the better ones, feel as
                  if
                  they have to comment on it or
                  justify it in some sense. Not here. THat they are lesbians simply makes them stick out in our minds
                  more. Make Corky (or even Violet...
                  which would be interesting in its own right) a man and almost nothing would change.</p>

                <p>Heist movies and film noir are not uncommon territory for the movies. Movies that combine both in
                  such
                  a spectacular fashion are. And
                  that's why I highly recommend "Bound."</p>

                  <p>From its very inception, "The Devil's Own" was in deep water. Current events and other factors
                    demanded rewrites (including filming without a finished script), much to the displeasure of star
                    Brad Pitt, who called it "a disaster" and "the most irresponsible piece of filimmaking" (Pitt
                    wanted to back out, but doing so would have cost him "$63 million for starters"). It was originally
                    going to be released for Oscar attention, but test audiences hated it, so it was pushed back to a
                    March
                    release date.</p>

                  <p>While such drama is normally a really bad sign, "The Devil's Own" manages to rise above it and come
                    out as a decent flick. It's by no means perfect, but for what it is, it's entertaining.</p>

                  <p>Frankie Maguire (Pitt) is a notorious IRA terrorist known as Frankie the Angel. Wanted for dozens
                    of
                    murders, Frankie barely escapes with his life after the British try to take him down (killing a
                    number of
                    his friends in the process). Frankie is sent to the US to pick up some stinger missiles, believing
                    that to
                    be the only way of getting the British government's attention. Now known as Rory Devaney, he is
                    staying at
                    the home of an IRA sympathizer's friend, a cop named Tom O'Meara (Ford). But the past doesn't stay
                    buried
                    forever, and Frankie's true purpose for being in New York is bound to catch up with him.</p>

                  <p>Despite all its problems, the film is strongly acted. Ford and Pitt, two consistently good actors,
                    do solid
                    work. It's not Oscar-worthy material from either of them, but they do their jobs. Ford is his usual
                    reliable
                    self
                    playing a good, moral cop facing a number of difficult choices. Pitt manages to get us on his side
                    despite the
                    fact
                    he is a terrorist capable of brutal acts of violence. Ruben Blades provides solid support as Tom's
                    partner,
                    although
                    his story is almost superfluous (it's meant to give the film color and allow the audience to
                    understand Tom's
                    motivations
                    for the final act, but it doesn't really work). Treat Williams turns up the nasty as a gunrunner,
                    and Natasha
                    McElhone
                    is good as Frankie's contact/love interest.</p>

                    alt="Communion">
                  <p>This was the final film of Alan J. Pakula, a director of some repute (he was killed in a car
                    accident shortly
                    after the
                    film was finished). It's solidly told, but there are a few concerns I have about the film. First the
                    film
                    makes no mention
                    of the Troubles. The backdrop is generic; substitute any conflict in its place and almost nothing
                    would
                    change. Not only
                    is this a little insulting to those who were affected by the conflict, it robs the film of a lot of
                    texture
                    and possible conflict.
                    Second, Pakula uses a light jaunty tune over a montage of Frankie and his friend Sean (Ronan)
                    preparing their
                    boat to take the
                    missiles back to Ireland. It's a little disconcerting, especially after 9/11. Finally, the film is a
                    little
                    too violent for its own
                    good. With a darker tone and more weight to the script (apparently this was the case for the
                    original script
                    that Pitt signed on to make,
                    but rewrites diluted it), the brutality would have been appropriate. As it is, it comes across as
                    excessive.
                  </p>

                  <p>Watching this movie, I couldn't help wishing it was more. With a stronger, richer script and
                    characters who
                    exhibited more
                    dimensions, this could have been the film it deserved to be. It raises a lot of interesting
                    questions.
                    Questions like, is terrorism ever
                    justified (which "Munich" asked nearly a decade later)? How does witnessing or committing acts of
                    violence
                    affect a person? How
                    does the act of arresting or possibly killing a man affect you if you know and love the person?
                    Compelling
                    questions to be sure,
                    but unfortunately there's no follow through.</p>

                  <p>If you're looking for a good thriller, this is an okay choice. I liked it. I was entertained. But I
                    kept
                    seeing the film that it
                    could have been. If only...</p>

                    <p>"Once Were Warriors" is one of those movies that hits you like a freight train and keeps
                      running
                      you over.
                      This is an incredibly tough movie to watch, but it pulls no punches. One has to admire director
                      Lee
                      Tamahori's
                      guts for not flinching when it comes to depicting the horrors of domestic violence.</p>

                    <p>On the surface, the Heke family seems to be normal and happy. But take one peek beneath the
                      "Kodak
                      moment,"
                      and you'll
                      find that they are anything but. The father, Jake (Morrison), is a desperate alcoholic and prone
                      to
                      extreme
                      violence
                      against anyone unfortunate enough to cross him. His wife, Beth (Owen), takes the brunt of it,
                      although by no
                      means is she
                      the only victim. Her oldest son, Nig (Arahanga) has joined a gang, her daughter Grace
                      (Kerr-Bell)
                      has sought
                      refuge living
                      with a friend in a burned out car, and younger son Boogie (Emile) is constantly in trouble with
                      the
                      law. But
                      when a brutal,
                      drunken beating leaves Beth unable to attend a court hearing for Boogie, she's had enough. She
                      puts
                      her foot
                      down, and the
                      results are not pretty.</p>

                    <p>Probably the most noticable reason why this film is so powerful is that the performances by the
                      two
                      leads are
                      nothing short
                      of astounding. Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison aren't merely good, they're superb. You've never
                      seen
                      acting
                      like this before.</p>

                    <p>Rena Owen garnered a number of awards for her fearless portrayal of a woman who finds the
                      strength
                      to stand
                      up to her husband,
                      and rightly so. Owen is miraculous, playing Beth as a tough yet loving wife and mother. She
                      loves
                      her husband
                      dearly, but his
                      abuse is no longer something she can accept. As Jake, Temuera Morrison is brilliant as a man
                      held
                      hostage by
                      his temper and his
                      addiction. Although he is a brutal, drunken thug, there is a kernel of humanity that is
                      desperate to
                      regain
                      control of himself.
                      The kids are solid, but this is really their show.</p>

                    <p>Ironically, the only one who got a career boost from this movie was director Lee Tamahori,
                      although
                      it wasn't
                      for the best.
                      Tamahori has since become a director of mediocre to awful action movies. Examples of his work
                      are
                      "The Edge,"
                      an unbelievably
                      lame adventure movie, and "Die Another Day," which caused the James Bond franchise to go into
                      turnaround until
                      it was rebooted
                      four years later. One wonders why he doesn't take the hint and go back to making gritty dramas
                      like
                      this
                      (although he did make
                      a biopic of Uday Hussein, but that doesn't really speak much to his talent). Probably because
                      the
                      money is too
                      good to turn down.</p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, the man's work here is a revelation. Tamahori never flinches, even when it comes
                      to
                      the film's
                      most disturbing scenes.
                      He doesn't sugarcoat anything and he is never coy. You have to admire a director who is willing
                      (and
                      able) to
                      take his audience
                      this far into a story that is so punishing. He also has a gift for directing actors, as anyone
                      who
                      watches
                      this movie can plainly see.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>While this film is extraordinariliy successful in its exploration of the issues of domestic
                      violence and
                      alcoholism, Tamahori's attempts to put it into a wider context fall short. The director attempts
                      to
                      address
                      the hardships that Maoris face in modern day
                      society, but the are unsuccessfuly presented, and for someone who isn't looking for them, easily
                      missed.</p>

                    <p>Whatever flaws the film may have, they are certainly not enough to make me think twice about
                      recommending
                      this film. On the contrary,
                      I enthusiastically encourage people to watch it. It is tough medicine to be sure, but worth it
                      in
                      the end. The
                      story is extraordinarily
                      powerful, and the acting by Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison is the stuff of legends. You don't
                      see
                      many movies
                      that have this kind of impact
                      on a viewer.</p>

                      <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to go on the American Family Association's Facebook page and get
                        into
                        spirited
                        debates
                        about certain issues. Usually regarding Target's policy of allowing transpeople to use the
                        bathroom
                        that they
                        identify
                        with, although they support any right-wing cause. As hilarious as the banter sometimes gets,
                        it's
                        also very
                        scary. The
                        blind faith of some of these individuals in the face of logic or the realitites of our legal
                        system,
                        or even
                        the hypocrisy
                        that they are unable to see is quite unsettling. Traits like that from religion can take people
                        down
                        a very
                        dark path.
                        "Frailty" is about one such individual.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      <p>A man named Fenton Meiks (McConaughey) has arrived at the office of FBI Agent Wesley Doyle
                        (Boothe). Doyle is
                        heading the
                        investigation into the notorious God's Hand serial killer, and Fenton claims that the killer is
                        his
                        brother
                        Adam. To explain
                        how he knows this, Fenton tells a disturbing story.</p>

                        alt="dinner">
                      <p>In the summer of 1979, Fenton (O'Leary) grew up in small town Texas with his father (Paxton)
                        and
                        younger
                        brother Adam (Sumpter).
                        Their mother died giving birth to Adam and they have no other surviving relatives, but they get
                        by.
                        Dad loves
                        his sons more than
                        anything and they love and respect him in turn. One night, Dad wakes them up, claiming that he
                        was
                        visited by
                        an angel who tasked
                        them with destroying demons that take human form. Adam is enthusiastic but Fenton is
                        incredulous.
                        It's too
                        difficult to swallow.
                        Fenton believes that this is all a nightmare that will pass, but then Dad brings home the first
                        body. More
                        will follow, and Fenton
                        has to find a way to stop the bloodshed. But that means convincing Adam, and worse, confronting
                        his
                        father.

                      <p>"Frailty" was marketed as some sort of supernatural slasher movie. Nothing could be further
                        from
                        the truth.
                        Physically, this isn't
                        a violent movie. Most of the violence occurs off screen, and there's very little gore.
                        Psychologically, well,
                        that's a different story.
                        Watching a young boy face the reality that his father has become a delusional killer is a brutal
                        blow to the
                        psyche. Even worse, he has
                        a younger brother who is too easily manipulated.</p>

                      <p>Paxton's character is not a traditional villain, and that's what makes this film so disturbing.
                        He's kind,
                        loving and affectionate
                        towards his children. In all other respects, he's a good man. But his delusions, if they are
                        that,
                        have turned
                        this gentle soul into
                        a murderous zealot. It would be difficult for anyone to accept, much less live through. To ask
                        that
                        of a
                        pre-teen is heartbreaking.
                        How would you react? It would be hard enough if it was your neighbor or a psychopath down the
                        street, but that
                        it is his father, whom
                        he loves dearly, makes things much more complicated. It would havea been too easy for Paxton to
                        take
                        the easy
                        road and make a slasher
                        film, but he goes the extra mile. He makes this about the situation, and the toll it takes on
                        his
                        children.

                      <p>The performances are strong across the board. Matthew McConaughey lends his low-key personality
                        to
                        the story,
                        ably portraying a man
                        who is dealing with a lifetime of guilt. Powers Boothe appears in what is essentially a plot
                        device,
                        but his
                        character is meant to be
                        a plot device and nothing more. He serves his purpose and that's all that's required of him.</p>

                      <p>As you might expect, the majority of the film is spent in 1979, with Paxton, O'Leary and
                        Sumpter
                        taking up
                        the majority of screen time.
                        All are effective, but special mention has to go to Matt O'Leary, who is excellent as the
                        morally
                        conflicted,
                        emotionally traumatized Fenton.
                        He has a tremendous burden on his shoulders that no one should have to carry, and the young
                        actor
                        handles the
                        complexities of his role with ease.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      <p>The opening scenes with Fenton and Doyle are a little rough, since they know things we don't
                        ore
                        rely on
                        assumptions that we can't make. But
                        they're not bad. The problem is with the ending. Paxton overplays his hand when it comes to the
                        ambiguity of
                        whether or not any of this is real,
                        but never more so than in the ending, which spells out exactly what happens. This is necessary
                        for
                        the twist
                        ending to work, but it feels like a
                        cheat. A more honest approach would have been better. The writing in these scenes is a little
                        sloppy
                        too, so
                        it's got that going against it as
                        well.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      <p>"Frailty" is not for everyone. It's very disturbing and not for younger viewers. I imagine that
                        a
                        few people
                        will be turned off by the trauma
                        that these young boys have to go through. I can understand their sentiments, but Paxton is
                        unrepentant. He
                        takes no prisoners and makes no
                        concessions. I applaud him for that. Had he done so, the film wouldn't have been as effective as
                        it
                        is.</p>

                      <p>Regardless, if you do see it, you will not forget it.</p>

                      <!--Review-->
                      <div>
                        <p>All throughout my life, there was no movie I was dying to see more than "I Know What You Did
                          Last
                          Summer."
                          I was constantly begging my parents to let me see it. Ask them if you don't believe me.
                          Looking
                          back, I'm glad
                          they
                          had the good sense not keep my fourth grade self from seeing a slasher movie, but there you
                          have it.
                          It's
                          really not
                          hard to see why it appealed to me. The trailer was awesome, the poster looked suitably
                          mysterious,
                          and let's
                          face it,
                          that's a hell of a great title.</p>

                        <p>It's July in a fishing village on the east coast. Julie James (Hewitt) is celebrating her
                          friend
                          Helen
                          Shivers (Gellar)
                          being elected the new beauty queen. They and their boyfriends, rich snob Barry Cox (Phillipe)
                          and
                          local boy
                          Ray Bronson (Prinze Jr.) are out partying on the beach. On the way home, drunk Barry (who at
                          least
                          has the
                          good sense to let
                          Ray drive...under protest, but there you have it) decides to stand in the sunroof and be an
                          asshole.
                          He
                          unfortunately splashes
                          liquor all over the car by accident. That's when he sees someone standing in the road. But
                          when he
                          screams,
                          "LOOK OUT!" it's too late.
                          The car smashes into a man who is now lying crumpled in the middle of the road. Unwilling to
                          throw
                          their lives
                          away, these four
                          friends decide to get rid of the evidence by throwing the body off the pier and never speaking
                          of it
                          again.
                          One year later, they realize
                          that you can run from your past, but there are some secrets that just won't die.</p>

                          alt="Helen with Mannequins">
                        <p>There are a few things that push "I Know What You Did Last Summer" into the upper echelon of
                          slasher movies
                          (more on that later).
                          First is that it has a strong story with an interesting subtext. Whodunits are always
                          interesting
                          because they
                          leave you hungering for
                          answers. The film is based on a story by teen thriller guru Lois Duncan, and it's a good
                          story. But
                          there's
                          something that Duncan and
                          screen scribe Kevin Williamson (whose script was put into production almost immediately after
                          "Scream" became
                          a massive hit) add to the
                          production that beefs up the plot and makes the characters more identifiable. The story shows,
                          without
                          pretension or needlessly drawing
                          out the story, how trauma and guilt can warp personalities and destroy relationships. Before
                          the
                          accident,
                          these four were close friends
                          with their own plans and dreams for the future. After the accident, none of these dreams have
                          been
                          realized
                          and they avoid each other like
                          the plague.</p>

                          alt="On the Boat">
                        <p>The performances help the film a lot. None of them are crying out for Oscar attention (in
                          fact,
                          they're not
                          especially memorable). But
                          they do succeed in getting us to identify with these people, and for a thriller to work,
                          that's
                          crucial.
                          Leading the pack are Jennifer Love
                          Hewitt, who makes Julie into a resourceful yet guil-ridden young woman, and Ryan Phillipe as
                          the
                          conceited
                          boor Barry. They have their stiff
                          moments, but they are mostly effective. Less impressive are Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie
                          Prinze
                          Jr.
                          Neither one of them has great range,
                          and it shows.</p>
                      </div>

                      <div>
                        <p>It's interesting to note that Lois Duncan disliked the movie intensely. Apart from the
                          premise,
                          almost
                          nothing from her book made it into the
                          film. She especially hated that the turned her thriller into a slasher movie after her own
                          daughter
                          was
                          murdered in 1989 (still unsolved). The
                          latter aspect is actually the film's problem. Kevin Williamson has changed the story's genre
                          (not
                          excatly a
                          rare occurrance) in a way that is not
                          particularly successful. The story and the characters are strong enough that gratuitous
                          violence and
                          chase
                          sequences are unnecessary (although it's
                          not as violent and gory as some other members of the genre).</p>
                      </div>

                      <div>
                        <p>Not that that hurts the film too much. It's put together with skill by Jim Gillespie (whose
                          later
                          films were
                          not particularly successful, making
                          me think that the lion's share of the credit has to go to Williamson, and to a lesser extent,
                          Duncan) and is
                          consistently suspenseful and scary. The
                          final scene is a tease, but still, where else can you find a whodunit where the heroine
                          actually
                          knows the
                          killer's motives before she knows who the
                          killer is?</p>
