    <p>People frequently ask me what my favorite movie is.  For the
    longest time, I couldn't answer.  How can I choose one from the
    hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen?  Sure,
    I've loved many films, but is it possible to shoose an absolute
    favorite?  Then I realized that the answer was right in front
    of me.  "Brotherhood of the Wolf" literally has everything.  A
    great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action, likable characters that
    are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous
    sex and nudity.  This admission isn't going to make me popular with 
    the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest sense of the word, it's
    a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the
    surface.  But as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.

    France, 1764.  In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast
    has been terrorizing the populace by maiming and killing women and children.
    It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace.  News of 
    monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it.
    One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with
    a biting wit.  The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood brother.
    Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be
    studied.  Of course, when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it
    seems.

    Everything about this movie is first-rate.  The acting is excellent,
    the action scenes are directed with flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere.
    What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable.  While it's true
    that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where
    the film takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this
    movie the label of "based on a true story" is about the same as saying that "Stargate"
    is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.

    Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly.  In addition to his
    occupations, he's a libertine with a wicked wit.  All of these qualites are shown
    in the film.  It doesn't take him long to realize that there's more than meets
    the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results
    in astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way.  His 
    wit is also razor sharp; some of his antics are hilarious.  Mark Dacascos doesn't
    say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in the action scenes.  He also
    shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible French.
