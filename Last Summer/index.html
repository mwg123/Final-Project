    <p>All throughout my life, there was no movie I was dying to see more than "I Know What You Did Last Summer."
    I was constantly begging my parents to let me see it.  Ask them if you don't believe me.  Looking back, I'm glad they
    had the good sense not keep my fourth grade self from seeing a slasher movie, but there you have it.  It's really not
    hard to see why it appealed to me.  The trailer was awesome, the poster looked suitably mysterious, and let's face it,
    that's a hell of a great title.</p>

    <p>It's July in a fishing village on the east coast.  Julie James (Hewitt) is celebrating her friend Helen Shivers (Gellar)
    being elected the new beauty queen.  They and their boyfriends, rich snob Barry Cox (Phillipe) and local boy
    Ray Bronson (Prinze Jr.) are out partying on the beach.  On the way home, drunk Barry (who at least has the good sense to let
    Ray drive...under protest, but there you have it) decides to stand in the sunroof and be an asshole.  He unfortunately splashes
    liquor all over the car by accident.  That's when he sees someone standing in the road.  But when he screams, "LOOK OUT!" it's too late.
    The car smashes into a man who is now lying crumpled in the middle of the road.  Unwilling to throw their lives away, these four
    friends decide to get rid of the evidence by throwing the body off the pier and never speaking of it again.  One year later, they realize
    that you can run from your past, but there are some secrets that just won't die.</p>

    <p>There are a few things that push "I Know What You Did Last Summer" into the upper echelon of slasher movies (more on that later).
    First is that it has a strong story with an interesting subtext.  Whodunits are always interesting because they leave you hungering for
    answers.  The film is based on a story by teen thriller guru Lois Duncan, and it's a good story.  But there's something that Duncan and
    screen scribe Kevin Williamson (whose script was put into production almost immediately after "Scream" became a massive hit) add to the
    production that beefs up the plot and makes the characters more identifiable.  The story shows, without pretension or needlessly drawing
    out the story, how trauma and guilt can warp personalities and destroy relationships.  Before the accident, these four were close friends
    with their own plans and dreams for the future.  After the accident, none of these dreams have been realized and they avoid each other like
    the plague.</p>

    <p>The performances help the film a lot.  None of them are crying out for Oscar attention (in fact, they're not especially memorable).  But
    they do succeed in getting us to identify with these people, and for a thriller to work, that's crucial.  Leading the pack are Jennifer Love
    Hewitt, who makes Julie into a resourceful yet guil-ridden young woman, and Ryan Phillipe as the conceited boor Barry.  They have their stiff
    moments, but they are mostly effective.  Less impressive are Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.  Neither one of them has great range,
    and it shows.</p>

    <p>It's interesting to note that Lois Duncan disliked the movie intensely.  Apart from the premise, almost nothing from her book made it into the
    film.  She especially hated that the turned her thriller into a slasher movie after her own daughter was murdered in 1989 (still unsolved).  The
    latter aspect is actually the film's problem.  Kevin Williamson has changed the story's genre (not excatly a rare occurrance) in a way that is not
    particularly successful.  The story and the characters are strong enough that gratuitous violence and chase sequences are unnecessary (although it's
    not as violent and gory as some other members of the genre).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>Not that that hurts the film too much.  It's put together with skill by Jim Gillespie (whose later films were not particularly successful, making 
    me think that the lion's share of the credit has to go to Williamson, and to a lesser extent, Duncan) and is consistently suspenseful and scary.  The
    final scene is a tease, but still, where else can you find a whodunit where the heroine actually knows the killer's motives before she knows who the
    killer is?</p>
