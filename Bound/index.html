    <p>A good caper will come up with an ingenious plot and call it a day.  A great one will know that's not
    enough.  You have to come up with a plot that seems perfect, and then have it go wrong in ways you don't expect.
    "Bound" fits into the latter category.  That it has time for strong writing and acting makes it something of a
    miracle.

    <p>Corky (Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who has just moved into a condo next to a sultry, raven-haired beauty
    named Violet (Tilly).  Violet's lover is Caesar (Pantoliano), who launders money for the local mob.  But Violet
    is unhappy, both sexually and personally, and when she sees Corky in the elevator, she sees hope for a way out.
    It just so happens that a local mob flunkie tried to abscond with $2 million plus, and the punishment ended up
    being a bloody mess.  Caesar has been tasked with (literally) laundering the money.  And there in lies an opportunity
    for Corky and Violet to get away with the money and leave the weasel Caesar to take the fall for it.</p>
