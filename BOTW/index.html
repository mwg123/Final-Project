    <p>People frequently ask me what my favorite movie is.  For the
    longest time, I couldn't answer.  How can I choose one from the
    hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen?  Sure,
    I've loved many films, but is it possible to shoose an absolute
    favorite?  Then I realized that the answer was right in front
    of me.  "Brotherhood of the Wolf" literally has everything.  A
    great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action, likable characters that
    are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous
    sex and nudity.  This admission isn't going to make me popular with 
    the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest sense of the word, it's
    a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the
    surface.  But as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.</p>

    <p>France, 1764.  In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast
    has been terrorizing the populace by maiming and killing women and children.
    It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace.  News of 
    monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it.
    One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with
    a biting wit.  The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood brother.
    Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be
    studied.  Of course, when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it
    seems.</p>

    <p>Everything about this movie is first-rate.  The acting is excellent,
    the action scenes are directed with flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere.
    What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable.  While it's true
    that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where
    the film takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this
    movie the label of "based on a true story" is about the same as saying that "Stargate"
    is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.</p>    

    <p>Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly.  In addition to his
    occupations, he's a libertine with a wicked wit.  All of these qualites are shown
    in the film.  It doesn't take him long to realize that there's more than meets
    the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results
    in astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way.  His 
    wit is also razor sharp; some of his antics are hilarious.  Mark Dacascos doesn't
    say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in the action scenes.  He also
    shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible French.</p>

    <p>The characters they meet in Gevudan are no less interesting.  There's Marianne
    (Dequenne), the daughter of a local aristocrat with whom Fronsac begins to
    woo (the scene where he introduces himself to her is hilarious).  Not only is
    she beautiful, but le Bihan and Dequenne have smoldering chemistry together, both as
    actors and as characters.  Marianne is a feisty girl, and she's not going to let just
    any man sweep her off her feet.  Jeremie Renier is also very good as Thomas d'Apcher,
    another young aristocrat who follows Fronsac around like a groupie.</p>

    <p>The two most well-known actors on this side of the Atlantic, Vincent Cassel
    and Monica Bellucci (who were at one point married in real life), are just as
    good as their co-stars.  Cassel plays Marianne's brother Jean-Francois, who
    lost his arm a few years prior in Africa.  Cassel is at his weird best, playing
    the character with both sympathy and mystery.  Bellucci has what is arguably the
    juciest part; she plays Sylvia, the prostitute who has an affinity for the strange
    and who may know more about what is going on than anyone.</p>

    <p>Christophe Gans deserves as much credit for the film's success as his stars.  Stylishly
    directed and containing more atmosphere than any movie in the past 20 years,
    Gans's work is truly incredible.  In addition to being able to sufficiently flesh out his
    characters within the contezxt of what is really an action movie (something that has eclipsed many
    filmmakers), he is also adept at sleight-of-hand.  There's no possible way to predict what happens
    further along down the road.  A person may be able to predict the "whodunit," but not why or how.
    At two-and-a-half hours, this is a fairly lengthy motion picture.  It doesn't feel like it, however.</p>

    <p>"Brotherhood of the Wolf" has the capacity to absorb from frame one, and it sticks with you long
    after the film is over.  I have watched this film many, many times, and it gets better with each
    successive viewing.  There aren't many movies that can make that claim.</p>
    <p><id="About">About the Director's Cut:</id> The film has become something of a cult classic over the years
    (according to Wikipedia, it grossed $11 million over here), which is great, although i have to 
    admit that it's kind of sad that people are so against subtitles and foreign films.  To be quite
    honest, there is nothing here for the arthouse crowd.  Substitue in known actors and have them
    speak English, and it would be a monster hit at the box office.</p>

    <p>The director's cut containst about ten minutes of extra footage, give or take.  Some of it is just
    minute extensions of some sequences, but there are two full scenes added in (although I believe a line
    from a voiceover has been eliminated for some reason).  I was wondering how a filmmaker could improve
    upon a film that, in my mind, is as close to perfect as possible?  It turns out that you can't.  The 
    extra scenes are really unnecessary and don't add much that we don't already know.  They only serve to
    pad out the running time and cause the carefully built momentum to drag.  Ironically, some of the deleted
    scenes that Gans talks about in the Extra Features are the ones that should have been left in, rather than
    the ones he actually put back into the film.  The theatrical cut gets a perfect score, but because of the 
    poor decisions he made, the Director's Cut slips to a three-and-a-half.</p>
