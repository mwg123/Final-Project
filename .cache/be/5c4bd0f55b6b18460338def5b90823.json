One has to admire director Lee Tamahori's\r\n        guts for not flinching when it comes to depicting the horrors of domestic violence.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <img id=\"bethAndJake\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.backseatmafia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Once-Were-Warriors.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080\" alt=\"Beth and Jake\">\r\n    <p>On the surface, the Heke family seems to be normal and happy.  But take one peek beneath the \"Kodak moment,\" and you'll\r\n    find that they are anything but.  The father, Jake (Morrison), is a desperate alcoholic and prone to extreme violence\r\n    against anyone unfortunate enough to cross him.  His wife, Beth (Owen), takes the brunt of it, although by no means is she\r\n    the only victim.  Her oldest son, Nig (Arahanga) has joined a gang, her daughter Grace (Kerr-Bell) has sought refuge living\r\n    with a friend in a burned out car, and younger son Boogie (Emile) is constantly in trouble with the law.  But when a brutal,\r\n    drunken beating leaves Beth unable to attend a court hearing for Boogie, she's had enough.  She puts her foot down, and the\r\n    results are not pretty.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <img id=\"argument\" src=\"https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1408142219/002/10391002_600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Argument\">\r\n    <p>Probably the most noticable reason why this film is so powerful is that the performances by the two leads are nothing short\r\n    of astounding.  Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison aren't merely good, they're superb.  You've never seen acting like this before.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Rena Owen garnered a number of awards for her fearless portrayal of a woman who finds the strength to stand up to her husband,\r\n    and rightly so.  Owen is miraculous, playing Beth as a tough yet loving wife and mother.  She loves her husband dearly, but his\r\n    abuse is no longer something she can accept.  As Jake, Temuera Morrison is brilliant as a man held hostage by his temper and his\r\n    addiction.  Although he is a brutal, drunken thug, there is a kernel of humanity that is desperate to regain control of himself.\r\n    The kids are solid, but this is really their show.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <img id=\"bloodyBeth\" src=\"https://trailersfromhell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5206c.jpg\" alt=\"Bloody Beth\">\r\n    <p>Ironically, the only one who got a career boost from this movie was director Lee Tamahori, although it wasn't for the best.\r\n    Tamahori has since become a director of mediocre to awful action movies.  Examples of his work are \"The Edge,\" an unbelievably\r\n    lame adventure movie, and \"Die Another Day,\" which caused the James Bond franchise to go into turnaround until it was rebooted\r\n    four years later.  One wonders why he doesn't take the hint and go back to making gritty dramas like this (although he did make\r\n    a biopic of Uday Hussein, but that doesn't really speak much to his talent).  Probably because the money is too good to turn down.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Nevertheless, the man's work here is a revelation.  Tamahori never flinches, even when it comes to the film's most disturbing scenes.\r\n    He doesn't sugarcoat anything and he is never coy.  You have to admire a director who is willing (and able) to take his audience\r\n    this far into a story that is so punishing.  He also has a gift for directing actors, as anyone who watches this movie can plainly see.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <p>While this film is extraordinariliy successful in its exploration of the issues of domestic violence and alcoholism, Tamahori's\r\n    attempts to put it into a wider context fall short.  The director attempts to address the hardships that Maoris face in modern day\r\n    society, but the are unsuccessfuly presented, and for someone who isn't looking for them, easily missed.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whatever flaws the film may have, they are certainly not enough to make me think twice about recommending this film.  On the contrary,\r\n    I enthusiastically encourage people to watch it.  It is tough medicine to be sure, but worth it in the end.  The story is extraordinarily\r\n    powerful, and the acting by Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison is the stuff of legends.  You don't see many movies that have this kind of impact\r\n    on a viewer.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"hash":"2eaf0a63656a2d2b2933408ac584fc41","cacheData":{}}
