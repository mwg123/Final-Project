Current events and other factors\r\n    demanded rewrites (including filming without a finished script), much to the displeasure of star\r\n    Brad Pitt, who called it \"a disaster\" and \"the most irresponsible piece of filimmaking\" (Pitt\r\n    wanted to back out, but doing so would have cost him \"$63 million for starters\").  It was originally\r\n    going to be released for Oscar attention, but test audiences hated it, so it was pushed back to a March\r\n    release date.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>While such drama is normally a really bad sign, \"The Devil's Own\" manages to rise above it and come \r\n    out as a decent flick.  It's by no means perfect, but for what it is, it's entertaining.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <img id=\"frankieWithAGun\" src=\"https://images4.static-bluray.com/reviews/362_1.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie with A Gun\">\r\n    <p>Frankie Maguire (Pitt) is a notorious IRA terrorist known as Frankie the Angel.  Wanted for dozens of\r\n    murders, Frankie barely escapes with his life after the British try to take him down (killing a number of\r\n    his friends in the process).  Frankie is sent to the US to pick up some stinger missiles, believing that to\r\n    be the only way of getting the British government's attention.  Now known as Rory Devaney, he is staying at\r\n    the home of an IRA sympathizer's friend, a cop named Tom O'Meara (Ford).  But the past doesn't stay buried\r\n    forever, and Frankie's true purpose for being in New York is bound to catch up with him.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Despite all its problems, the film is strongly acted.  Ford and Pitt, two consistently good actors, do solid\r\n    work.  It's not Oscar-worthy material from either of them, but they do their jobs.  Ford is his usual reliable self\r\n    playing a good, moral cop facing a number of difficult choices.  Pitt manages to get us on his side despite the fact\r\n    he is a terrorist capable of brutal acts of violence.  Ruben Blades provides solid support as Tom's partner, although\r\n    his story is almost superfluous (it's meant to give the film color and allow the audience to understand Tom's motivations\r\n    for the final act, but it doesn't really work).  Treat Williams turns up the nasty as a gunrunner, and Natasha McElhone\r\n    is good as Frankie's contact/love interest.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n    <img id=\"communion\" src=\"https://www.hotflick.net/flicks/1997_The_Devil_s_Own/997TDO_Julia_Stiles_003.jpg\" alt=\"Communion\">\r\n    <p>This was the final film of Alan J. Pakula, a director of some repute (he was killed in a car accident shortly after the\r\n    film was finished).  It's solidly told, but there are a few concerns I have about the film.  First the film makes no mention\r\n    of the Troubles.  The backdrop is generic; substitute any conflict in its place and almost nothing would change.  Not only\r\n    is this a little insulting to those who were affected by the conflict, it robs the film of a lot of texture and possible conflict.\r\n    Second, Pakula uses a light jaunty tune over a montage of Frankie and his friend Sean (Ronan) preparing their boat to take the\r\n    missiles back to Ireland.  It's a little disconcerting, especially after 9/11.  Finally, the film is a little too violent for its own\r\n    good.  With a darker tone and more weight to the script (apparently this was the case for the original script that Pitt signed on to make,\r\n    but rewrites diluted it), the brutality would have been appropriate.  As it is, it comes across as excessive.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Watching this movie, I couldn't help wishing it was more.  With a stronger, richer script and characters who exhibited more\r\n    dimensions, this could have been the film it deserved to be.  It raises a lot of interesting questions.  Questions like, is terrorism ever\r\n    justified (which \"Munich\" asked nearly a decade later)?  How does witnessing or committing acts of violence affect a person?  How\r\n    does the act of arresting or possibly killing a man affect you if you know and love the person?  Compelling questions to be sure,\r\n    but unfortunately there's no follow through.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you're looking for a good thriller, this is an okay choice.  I liked it.  I was entertained.  But I kept seeing the film that it\r\n    could have been.  If only...</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"hash":"bf0add94865e8eee58eef5e98136c1f4","cacheData":{}}
