So why did I spend more money than usual to see a \r\n    spin-off movie of the show in the theater?  I'm not sure, really.  A chance to\r\n    dish out some bile? Or perhaps to see if, now that I've seen some good anime (like \"Inuyasha\" or anything)\r\n    by Hayao Miyazaki, it wasn't as bad as I remember (the latter is why I subjected myself\r\n    to watching \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" a second time).  If nothing else, it could give me another entry for \r\n    my Bottom 10 list this year.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>So what's the verdict?  Look at the rating and take a guess.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\"Dragonball Z: Resurrection \"F\" is for fans only.  Anyone who hasn't grown to love\r\n    the characters while watching the show will find little of any interest here.  Granted,\r\n    \"Inuyasha: Affections Touching Across Time\" wasn't the most friendly to people who weren't\r\n    already fans of the show, but it at least gave a perfunctory set-up.  That doesn't happen\r\n    here, where there is no set-up or character development whatsoever.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <img id=\"movieImageOne\" src=\"http://www.islabit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dragon-Ball-Resurrection-of-F.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Image One\">\r\n\r\n    <p>Megalomaniac Frieza (Ayres) has just been resurrected by his second-in-command \r\n    Sorbet (Schwartz).  Item number one on his agenda is getting revenge on Goku (Schemmel),\r\n    the Earthling who destroyed him.  Despite Sorbet's attempts to convince him that there \r\n    are far more opportunities to expand his empire if he leaves Goku alone, Frieza won't be\r\n    dissuaded.  So after he trains himself (for the first time, I might add), he heads to the\r\n    planet of the humans.  Unfortunately, his nemesis is off planet in a training session of\r\n    his own.  So Freiza amuses himself by destroying a city and having his minions attack\r\n    Goku's friends.  Then Goku and his brother/rival/partner/something Gohan show up, and the\r\n    real fight begins.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That's essentially it for the plot.  I assume the appeal for fans is the same for \"The Avengers:\"\r\n    Seeing all your favorite characters in one movie team up for a massive smackdown.  Unfortunately,\r\n    the action scenes are so basic (in choreography and method) that there's almost no tension.  Flying\r\n    through the trees and shooting balls of light at each other would be tough for even James Cameron \r\n    to make exciting, and director Tadayoshi Yamamuro is <em>definitely</em> no James Cameron.</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"movieImageTwo\" src=\"https://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/dragon-ball-z-resurrection-f/9-1.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Image Two\">\r\n\r\n    <p>The fight between Goku and Frieza, which takes up the latter half of the film, is equally lifeless.\r\n    One of the reasons why the show sucked is that their moves were so repetitive and basic. I don't know\r\n    about you, but watching two guys with obvious steroid problems become living fireworks and shooting balls\r\n    of light at each other isn't especially cinematic.  Especially if they scream like they are heavily\r\n    constipated and trying to use the bathroom.  Even worse, shots are poorly framed and the choreography is\r\n    painfully basic.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As for the voice acting...well, it's no better.  Every voice actor is terrible; they sound obnoxious\r\n    and annoying and speak dialogue that is trite and stupid.  I'll freely admit that good dialogue in \"Inuyasha\"\r\n    is pretty rare, but at least the actors are talented enough to speak with conviction and appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"movieImageThree\" src=\"http://ocs-pl.oktawave.com/v1/AUTH_2887234e-384a-4873-8bc5-405211db13a2/splay/2015/08/Dragon-Ball-Z-Resurrection-F-2.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Image Three\">\r\n\r\n    <p>\"Dragonball Z: Resurrection F\" is just as lame as the TV show.  But what is really sad is that it was\r\n    well-marketed and got a lot of fans.  Everyone else saw it for what it was: a piece of crap.  Unlike the\r\n    best anime, it doesn't stimulate the mind or touch the heart.  It's just senseless, mind-rotting noise\r\n    that cost the genre a lot of fans.  The best the film can come up with is a few mildly amusing jokes, most\r\n    of which would be considered lame for an afternoon sitcom.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>If you were like me and had a bias against anime from this show, please, don't give up on it.  Movies like\r\n    \"Spirited Away\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies\" entertain in ways no traditional film ever could, animated or\r\n    otherwise.  And if you're a \"Dragonball Z\" fan, see these other films to see how low you've set the bar.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</body></html>"},"hash":"546386eb25fd509edd0e6c0ab99e4326","cacheData":{}}
