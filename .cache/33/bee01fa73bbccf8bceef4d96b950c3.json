For the longest time, I couldn't answer. How can I choose one from the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen? Sure, I've loved many films, but is it possible to shoose an absolute favorite? Then I realized that the answer was right in front of me. \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" literally has everything. A great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action, likable characters that are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous sex and nudity. This admission isn't going to make me popular with the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest sense of the word, it's a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the surface. But as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.</p>\r\n            <p>France, 1764. In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast has been terrorizing the populace by maiming and killing women and children. It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace. News of monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it. One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with a biting wit. The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood brother. Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be studied. Of course, when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it seems.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"fronsacAndThomas\" src=\"http://ricedawg.phpwebhosting.com/riceworld/reviews_movies/BOTW/jeremie_renier5.jpg\" alt=\"Fronsac and Thomas\">\r\n            <p>Everything about this movie is first-rate. The acting is excellent, the action scenes are directed with flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere. What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable. While it's true that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where the film takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this movie the label of \"based on a true story\" is about the same as saying that \"Stargate\" is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.</p>\r\n            <p>Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly. In addition to his occupations, he's a libertine with a wicked wit. All of these qualites are shown in the film. It doesn't take him long to realize that there's more than meets the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results in astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way. His wit is also razor sharp; some of his antics are hilarious. Mark Dacascos doesn't say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in the action scenes. He also shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible French.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"fightScene\" src=\"https://gradingfightscenes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mani3.png?w=512&amp;h=290\" alt=\"Fight Scene\">\r\n            <p>The characters they meet in Gevudan are no less interesting. There's Marianne (Dequenne), the daughter of a local aristocrat with whom Fronsac begins to woo (the scene where he introduces himself to her is hilarious). Not only is she beautiful, but le Bihan and Dequenne have smoldering chemistry together, both as actors and as characters. Marianne is a feisty girl, and she's not going to let just any man sweep her off her feet. Jeremie Renier is also very good as Thomas d'Apcher, another young aristocrat who follows Fronsac around like a groupie.</p>\r\n            <p>The two most well-known actors on this side of the Atlantic, Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci (who were at one point married in real life), are just as good as their co-stars. Cassel plays Marianne's brother Jean-Francois, who lost his arm a few years prior in Africa. Cassel is at his weird best, playing the character with both sympathy and mystery. Bellucci has what is arguably the juciest part; she plays Sylvia, the prostitute who has an affinity for the strange and who may know more about what is going on than anyone.</p>\r\n            <p>Christophe Gans deserves as much credit for the film's success as his stars. Stylishly directed and containing more atmosphere than any movie in the past 20 years, Gans's work is truly incredible. In addition to being able to sufficiently flesh out his characters within the contezxt of what is really an action movie (something that has eclipsed many filmmakers), he is also adept at sleight-of-hand. There's no possible way to predict what happens further along down the road. A person may be able to predict the \"whodunit,\" but not why or how. At two-and-a-half hours, this is a fairly lengthy motion picture. It doesn't feel like it, however.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"findingAClue\" src=\"https://www.mad-movies.com/images/MM_MoviesBackdrops/2731/gSuTachGuhFVD13EwhJbN3sulRR.jpg\" alt=\"Finding a Clue\">\r\n            <p>\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" has the capacity to absorb from frame one, and it sticks with you long after the film is over. I have watched this film many, many times, and it gets better with each successive viewing. There aren't many movies that can make that claim.</p>\r\n            <p><i id=\"About\">About the Director's Cut:</i> The film has become something of a cult classic over the years (according to Wikipedia, it grossed $11 million over here), which is great, although i have to admit that it's kind of sad that people are so against subtitles and foreign films. To be quite honest, there is nothing here for the arthouse crowd. Substitue in known actors and have them speak English, and it would be a monster hit at the box office.</p>\r\n            <p>The director's cut containst about ten minutes of extra footage, give or take. Some of it is just minute extensions of some sequences, but there are two full scenes added in (although I believe a line from a voiceover has been eliminated for some reason). I was wondering how a filmmaker could improve upon a film that, in my mind, is as close to perfect as possible? It turns out that you can't. The extra scenes are really unnecessary and don't add much that we don't already know. They only serve to pad out the running time and cause the carefully built momentum to drag. Ironically, some of the deleted scenes that Gans talks about in the Extra Features are the ones that should have been left in, rather than the ones he actually put back into the film. The theatrical cut gets a perfect score, but because of the poor decisions he made, the Director's Cut slips to a three-and-a-half.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <p>Trailer:</p>\r\n            <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"//cdn.traileraddict.com/css/rembed.css\">\r\n            <div class=\"outer-embed-ta\">\r\n              <iframe width=\"300\" src=\"//v.traileraddict.com/56721\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"embed-ta\"></iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p><a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com/brotherhood-wolf/theatrical-trailer\">Theatrical Trailer</a> for <a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com/brotherhood-wolf\">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a> on <a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com\">TrailerAddict</a>.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Action movies don't get much better than this!</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Spirited Away box-->\r\n        <a onclick=\"toggle('Spirited Away');\"><img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://bsckids.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0dcfe3c2c4aac937273d5563ca9a029753f1acb6.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">Spirited Away</a>\r\n      <p>One of cinema's finest treasures</p>\r\n        <div class=\"Spirited Away\">\r\n                <div class=\"review\">\r\n                        <!--Statistics-->\r\n                        <h1>Spirited Away</h1>\r\n                        <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://bsckids.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0dcfe3c2c4aac937273d5563ca9a029753f1acb6.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">\r\n                        <p>FOUR OUT OF FOUR</p>\r\n                        <p>Starring (voices): Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette,\r\n                            Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers</p>\r\n                        <p>Rated PG for Some Scary Moments</p>    \r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n                        <!--Review-->\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                    <img id=\"bathhouse\" src=\"https://wardrobejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/spirited_away_screenshot_3_by_anian0-d4epnpx.jpg\" alt=\"The Bathhouse\">\r\n                        <p>I love this movie.  I love it with all my heart.  \"Spirited Away,\"\r\n                        written and directed by master storyteller Hayao Miyazaki, is a true\r\n                        masterpiece.  Not only is it the finest animated film ever made, it is\r\n                        one of the finest animated films ever made period.  It deserves a place\r\n                        alongside \"The Godfather,\" \"Schindler's List,\" and \"Casablanca.\"  Visually\r\n                        dazzling, emotionally complex and splendidly told, this is truly a movie for\r\n                        all to enjoy.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                    <img id=\"landscape\" src=\"http://fanaru.com/spirited-away/image/116169-spirited-away-travel-scene.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape\">\r\n                        <p>Chihiro (Chase) is a whiny brat who is upset that she's having to move to\r\n                        the middle of nowhere with her parents (voiced by Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis).\r\n                        On the way there, they get sidetracked and end up in an abandoned theme park...or so\r\n                        they think.  Chihiro's parents begin to chow down on delicious food (that they'll pay\r\n                        for later), but they end up turning into pigs.  Now Chihiro is trapped in the world of\r\n                        the gods and forced to work in a bathouse run by the vicious Yubaba (Pleshette).  Her\r\n                        allies are few, and she has to remember who she is if she is to rescue her parents\r\n                        return to our world.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                        All his films are wildly imaginative, but none moreso than \"Spirited Away.\"  This is a\r\n                        truly beautiful film that would be worth watching on mute.  Miyazaki fills the screen with\r\n                        wonderful and bizarre creatures that capture the eye as well as the mind.  From the three\r\n                        bouncing heads in Yubaba's office to the mysterious Noh-Face that lurks in the background,\r\n                        there is never a dull moment for they eyes.  In fact, this whole world, particularly the \r\n                        bathhouse, begs \"Explore Me!\"<p></p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                <img id=\"yubaba\" src=\"https://sweensryche.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/chihiro-yubaba-spirited-away-399712_953_516.jpg\" alt=\"Yubaba\">\r\n                        <p>The second thing one notices is the complexity of the story.  Disney movies, even the\r\n                        best ones, are constrained by formulas.  That doesn't happen here.  There's no telling\r\n                        where this story is going to go.  Miyazaki carefully lets it unfold as Chihiro sees it.\r\n                        We don't know any more about this strange place than she does.  The story also plays by\r\n                        different rules than most American films.  The themes of identity and transformation\r\n                        (people are rarely who they seem, in a both literal and figurative sense) are, as told by\r\n                        Miyazaki, different than what we're used to.  Yet, at its heart, this is really a coming of\r\n                        age story.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                        <p>The voice acting is fantastic.  Daveigh Chase is terrific as Chihiro.  This is a girl we\r\n                        can all get behind and root for.  Chase, who famously played Samara in \"The Ring,\" has a\r\n                        tendency to get shrill when she screams, but those moments are few.  Jason Marsden, a popular\r\n                        Disney voice actor, is positively perfect as Haku, the mysterious boy who may or may not be\r\n                        helping Chihiro.  His voice is soothing and seductive, and Miyazaki draws him in such a way\r\n                        that is both threatening and romantic.  Susan Egan, also a good voice actress, is terrific as\r\n                        Lin, Chihiro's feisty freind.  The late great Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film appearance) \r\n                        is suitably menacing as the boss who controlls her workers by stealing their names.  At the very\r\n                        least, no one can claim that Yubaba isn't an original villain.  And yet, Pleshette gives the character\r\n                        some humanity, mainly by having her dote on her giant baby (Strong).</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    \r\n                            <div>\r\n                        <p>While Kirk Wise may have directed the English speaking voice actors (and added a few lines), this is\r\n                        all Miyazaki.  It has all his trademarks: vivid images, characters that touch the heart and a strong\r\n                        storytelling ability.  But more important is the feel of the film.  Miyazaki is a master of tone; all his\r\n                        films have a sense of magical whimsy that only he can create.  The wonderful musical score by Joe Hisaishi\r\n                        (who always scores Miyazaki's films), is beautiful and evocative without feeling overly manipulative.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                        <p>\"Spirited Away\" is a true masterpiece and while it achieved immense critical and overseas success (it\r\n                        outgroosed \"Titanic\" to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history), it's still a cult movie in \r\n                        many respects.  That's a shame, because anyone who watches it will see it for what it is: a one of a kind\r\n                        moviegoing experience.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Dragonball Z \"Resurrection F\" box-->\r\n      <img class=\"moviePoster\" id=\"dbzPoster\" src=\"http://data.en.yibada.com/data/images/full/24789/dragon-ball-z-resurrection-f.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\"> <a href=\"/d6da4260e880ec923525e0934f80112a.html\">Dragonball Z: Resurrection F</a>\r\n      <p>Don't.
