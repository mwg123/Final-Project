For the longest time, I couldn't answer. How can I choose one from the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of movies that I have seen? Sure, I've loved many films, but is it possible to shoose an absolute favorite? Then I realized that the answer was right in front of me. \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" literally has everything. A great, twisty plot, bone-crunching action, likable characters that are sufficiently developed, lots of blood and gore, and some gratuitous sex and nudity. This admission isn't going to make me popular with the cinephiles, since as a film in the truest sense of the word, it's a competently made movie with aboslutely nothing of value beneath the surface. But as pure entertainment, it doesn't get any better.</p>\r\n            <p>France, 1764. In the remote province of Gevudan, a mysterious beast has been terrorizing the populace by maiming and killing women and children. It attacks without mercy then disappears without a trace. News of monster has reached Paris, and the king sends two men to deal with it. One is Gregoire de Fronsac (le Bihan), a naturalist and taxidermist with a biting wit. The other is Mani (Dacascos), his Indian blood brother. Their job is to find the beast, kill it, and bring it back to Paris to be studied. Of course, when they get there, they realize that nothing is what it seems.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"fronsacAndThomas\" src=\"http://ricedawg.phpwebhosting.com/riceworld/reviews_movies/BOTW/jeremie_renier5.jpg\" alt=\"Fronsac and Thomas\">\r\n            <p>Everything about this movie is first-rate. The acting is excellent, the action scenes are directed with flair, and the film oozes with atmosphere. What's more, the film's storyline is anything but predictable. While it's true that there was a wolf who killed a number of women and children when and where the film takes place, and all the characters (except Mani) did exist, giving this movie the label of \"based on a true story\" is about the same as saying that \"Stargate\" is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology.</p>\r\n            <p>Samuel le Bihan plays the part of the hero perfectly. In addition to his occupations, he's a libertine with a wicked wit. All of these qualites are shown in the film. It doesn't take him long to realize that there's more than meets the eye, but he isn't plagued with any of the laziness of writing that results in astonishing leaps of intelligence; we're with him every step of the way. His wit is also razor sharp; some of his antics are hilarious. Mark Dacascos doesn't say much, but he looks fearsome and he's terrific in the action scenes. He also shows skill with non-vocal emoting, and for an American, he speaks credible French.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"fightScene\" src=\"https://gradingfightscenes.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mani3.png?w=512&amp;h=290\" alt=\"Fight Scene\">\r\n            <p>The characters they meet in Gevudan are no less interesting. There's Marianne (Dequenne), the daughter of a local aristocrat with whom Fronsac begins to woo (the scene where he introduces himself to her is hilarious). Not only is she beautiful, but le Bihan and Dequenne have smoldering chemistry together, both as actors and as characters. Marianne is a feisty girl, and she's not going to let just any man sweep her off her feet. Jeremie Renier is also very good as Thomas d'Apcher, another young aristocrat who follows Fronsac around like a groupie.</p>\r\n            <p>The two most well-known actors on this side of the Atlantic, Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci (who were at one point married in real life), are just as good as their co-stars. Cassel plays Marianne's brother Jean-Francois, who lost his arm a few years prior in Africa. Cassel is at his weird best, playing the character with both sympathy and mystery. Bellucci has what is arguably the juciest part; she plays Sylvia, the prostitute who has an affinity for the strange and who may know more about what is going on than anyone.</p>\r\n            <p>Christophe Gans deserves as much credit for the film's success as his stars. Stylishly directed and containing more atmosphere than any movie in the past 20 years, Gans's work is truly incredible. In addition to being able to sufficiently flesh out his characters within the contezxt of what is really an action movie (something that has eclipsed many filmmakers), he is also adept at sleight-of-hand. There's no possible way to predict what happens further along down the road. A person may be able to predict the \"whodunit,\" but not why or how. At two-and-a-half hours, this is a fairly lengthy motion picture. It doesn't feel like it, however.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <img id=\"findingAClue\" src=\"https://www.mad-movies.com/images/MM_MoviesBackdrops/2731/gSuTachGuhFVD13EwhJbN3sulRR.jpg\" alt=\"Finding a Clue\">\r\n            <p>\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\" has the capacity to absorb from frame one, and it sticks with you long after the film is over. I have watched this film many, many times, and it gets better with each successive viewing. There aren't many movies that can make that claim.</p>\r\n            <p><i id=\"About\">About the Director's Cut:</i> The film has become something of a cult classic over the years (according to Wikipedia, it grossed $11 million over here), which is great, although i have to admit that it's kind of sad that people are so against subtitles and foreign films. To be quite honest, there is nothing here for the arthouse crowd. Substitue in known actors and have them speak English, and it would be a monster hit at the box office.</p>\r\n            <p>The director's cut containst about ten minutes of extra footage, give or take. Some of it is just minute extensions of some sequences, but there are two full scenes added in (although I believe a line from a voiceover has been eliminated for some reason). I was wondering how a filmmaker could improve upon a film that, in my mind, is as close to perfect as possible? It turns out that you can't. The extra scenes are really unnecessary and don't add much that we don't already know. They only serve to pad out the running time and cause the carefully built momentum to drag. Ironically, some of the deleted scenes that Gans talks about in the Extra Features are the ones that should have been left in, rather than the ones he actually put back into the film. The theatrical cut gets a perfect score, but because of the poor decisions he made, the Director's Cut slips to a three-and-a-half.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <p>Trailer:</p>\r\n            <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"//cdn.traileraddict.com/css/rembed.css\">\r\n            <div class=\"outer-embed-ta\">\r\n              <iframe width=\"300\" src=\"//v.traileraddict.com/56721\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"embed-ta\"></iframe>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p><a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com/brotherhood-wolf/theatrical-trailer\">Theatrical Trailer</a> for <a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com/brotherhood-wolf\">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a> on <a href=\"https://www.traileraddict.com\">TrailerAddict</a>.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>Action movies don't get much better than this!</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Spirited Away box-->\r\n        <a onclick=\"toggle('Spirited Away');\"><img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://bsckids.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0dcfe3c2c4aac937273d5563ca9a029753f1acb6.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">Spirited Away</a>\r\n      <p>One of cinema's finest treasures</p>\r\n        <div id=\"Spirited Away\" style=\"z-index: 0; display:none\">\r\n                <div class=\"review\">\r\n                        <!--Statistics-->\r\n                        <h1>Spirited Away</h1>\r\n                        <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://bsckids.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/0dcfe3c2c4aac937273d5563ca9a029753f1acb6.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">\r\n                        <p>FOUR OUT OF FOUR</p>\r\n                        <p>Starring (voices): Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette,\r\n                            Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers</p>\r\n                        <p>Rated PG for Some Scary Moments</p>    \r\n                        \r\n                    \r\n                        <!--Review-->\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                    <img id=\"bathhouse\" src=\"https://wardrobejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/spirited_away_screenshot_3_by_anian0-d4epnpx.jpg\" alt=\"The Bathhouse\">\r\n                        <p>I love this movie.  I love it with all my heart.  \"Spirited Away,\"\r\n                        written and directed by master storyteller Hayao Miyazaki, is a true\r\n                        masterpiece.  Not only is it the finest animated film ever made, it is\r\n                        one of the finest animated films ever made period.  It deserves a place\r\n                        alongside \"The Godfather,\" \"Schindler's List,\" and \"Casablanca.\"  Visually\r\n                        dazzling, emotionally complex and splendidly told, this is truly a movie for\r\n                        all to enjoy.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                    <img id=\"landscape\" src=\"http://fanaru.com/spirited-away/image/116169-spirited-away-travel-scene.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape\">\r\n                        <p>Chihiro (Chase) is a whiny brat who is upset that she's having to move to\r\n                        the middle of nowhere with her parents (voiced by Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis).\r\n                        On the way there, they get sidetracked and end up in an abandoned theme park...or so\r\n                        they think.  Chihiro's parents begin to chow down on delicious food (that they'll pay\r\n                        for later), but they end up turning into pigs.  Now Chihiro is trapped in the world of\r\n                        the gods and forced to work in a bathouse run by the vicious Yubaba (Pleshette).  Her\r\n                        allies are few, and she has to remember who she is if she is to rescue her parents\r\n                        return to our world.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                        All his films are wildly imaginative, but none moreso than \"Spirited Away.\"  This is a\r\n                        truly beautiful film that would be worth watching on mute.  Miyazaki fills the screen with\r\n                        wonderful and bizarre creatures that capture the eye as well as the mind.  From the three\r\n                        bouncing heads in Yubaba's office to the mysterious Noh-Face that lurks in the background,\r\n                        there is never a dull moment for they eyes.  In fact, this whole world, particularly the \r\n                        bathhouse, begs \"Explore Me!\"<p></p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                                <img id=\"yubaba\" src=\"https://sweensryche.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/chihiro-yubaba-spirited-away-399712_953_516.jpg\" alt=\"Yubaba\">\r\n                        <p>The second thing one notices is the complexity of the story.  Disney movies, even the\r\n                        best ones, are constrained by formulas.  That doesn't happen here.  There's no telling\r\n                        where this story is going to go.  Miyazaki carefully lets it unfold as Chihiro sees it.\r\n                        We don't know any more about this strange place than she does.  The story also plays by\r\n                        different rules than most American films.  The themes of identity and transformation\r\n                        (people are rarely who they seem, in a both literal and figurative sense) are, as told by\r\n                        Miyazaki, different than what we're used to.  Yet, at its heart, this is really a coming of\r\n                        age story.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                        <p>The voice acting is fantastic.  Daveigh Chase is terrific as Chihiro.  This is a girl we\r\n                        can all get behind and root for.  Chase, who famously played Samara in \"The Ring,\" has a\r\n                        tendency to get shrill when she screams, but those moments are few.  Jason Marsden, a popular\r\n                        Disney voice actor, is positively perfect as Haku, the mysterious boy who may or may not be\r\n                        helping Chihiro.  His voice is soothing and seductive, and Miyazaki draws him in such a way\r\n                        that is both threatening and romantic.  Susan Egan, also a good voice actress, is terrific as\r\n                        Lin, Chihiro's feisty freind.  The late great Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film appearance) \r\n                        is suitably menacing as the boss who controlls her workers by stealing their names.  At the very\r\n                        least, no one can claim that Yubaba isn't an original villain.  And yet, Pleshette gives the character\r\n                        some humanity, mainly by having her dote on her giant baby (Strong).</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    \r\n                        <div>\r\n                        <p>While Kirk Wise may have directed the English speaking voice actors (and added a few lines), this is\r\n                        all Miyazaki.  It has all his trademarks: vivid images, characters that touch the heart and a strong\r\n                        storytelling ability.  But more important is the feel of the film.  Miyazaki is a master of tone; all his\r\n                        films have a sense of magical whimsy that only he can create.  The wonderful musical score by Joe Hisaishi\r\n                        (who always scores Miyazaki's films), is beautiful and evocative without feeling overly manipulative.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                        <p>\"Spirited Away\" is a true masterpiece and while it achieved immense critical and overseas success (it\r\n                        outgroosed \"Titanic\" to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history), it's still a cult movie in \r\n                        many respects.  That's a shame, because anyone who watches it will see it for what it is: a one of a kind\r\n                        moviegoing experience.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Dragonball Z \"Resurrection F\" box-->\r\n      <a onclick=\"toggle('DBZ');\"> <img class=\"moviePoster\" id=\"dbzPoster\" src=\"http://data.en.yibada.com/data/images/full/24789/dragon-ball-z-resurrection-f.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\"> Dragonball Z: Resurrection F</a>\r\n      <p>Don't.

Or perhaps to see if, now that I've seen some good anime (like \"Inuyasha\" or anything)\r\n                by Hayao Miyazaki, it wasn't as bad as I remember (the latter is why I subjected myself\r\n                to watching \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" a second time).

Item number one on his agenda is getting revenge on Goku (Schemmel),\r\n                the Earthling who destroyed him.  Despite Sorbet's attempts to convince him that there \r\n                are far more opportunities to expand his empire if he leaves Goku alone, Frieza won't be\r\n                dissuaded.  So after he trains himself (for the first time, I might add), he heads to the\r\n                planet of the humans.  Unfortunately, his nemesis is off planet in a training session of\r\n                his own.  So Freiza amuses himself by destroying a city and having his minions attack\r\n                Goku's friends.  Then Goku and his brother/rival/partner/something Gohan show up, and the\r\n                real fight begins.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <img id=\"movieImageThree\" src=\"http://ocs-pl.oktawave.com/v1/AUTH_2887234e-384a-4873-8bc5-405211db13a2/splay/2015/08/Dragon-Ball-Z-Resurrection-F-2.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Image Three\">    \r\n                <p>That's essentially it for the plot.  I assume the appeal for fans is the same for \"The Avengers:\"\r\n                Seeing all your favorite characters in one movie team up for a massive smackdown.  Unfortunately,\r\n                the action scenes are so basic (in choreography and method) that there's almost no tension.  Flying\r\n                through the trees and shooting balls of light at each other would be tough for even James Cameron \r\n                to make exciting, and director Tadayoshi Yamamuro is <em>definitely</em> no James Cameron.</p>\r\n                <p>The fight between Goku and Frieza, which takes up the latter half of the film, is equally lifeless.\r\n                One of the reasons why the show sucked is that their moves were so repetitive and basic. I don't know\r\n                about you, but watching two guys with obvious steroid problems become living fireworks and shooting balls\r\n                of light at each other isn't especially cinematic.  Especially if they scream like they are heavily\r\n                constipated and trying to use the bathroom.  Even worse, shots are poorly framed and the choreography is\r\n                painfully basic.</p>\r\n            \r\n                <p>As for the voice acting...well, it's no better.  Every voice actor is terrible; they sound obnoxious\r\n                and annoying and speak dialogue that is trite and stupid.  I'll freely admit that good dialogue in \"Inuyasha\"\r\n                is pretty rare, but at least the actors are talented enough to speak with conviction and appeal.</p>\r\n            \r\n                <p>\"Dragonball Z: Resurrection F\" is just as lame as the TV show.  But what is really sad is that it was\r\n                well-marketed and got a lot of fans.  Everyone else saw it for what it was: a piece of crap.  Unlike the\r\n                best anime, it doesn't stimulate the mind or touch the heart.  It's just senseless, mind-rotting noise\r\n                that cost the genre a lot of fans.  The best the film can come up with is a few mildly amusing jokes, most\r\n                of which would be considered lame for an afternoon sitcom.</p>\r\n            \r\n                <p>If you were like me and had a bias against anime from this show, please, don't give up on it.  Movies like\r\n                \"Spirited Away\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies\" entertain in ways no traditional film ever could, animated or\r\n                otherwise.  And if you're a \"Dragonball Z\" fan, see these other films to see how low you've set the bar.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n            \r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Bound box-->\r\n      <a onclick=\"toggle('DBZ');\"> <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/bound-1996/large_2xrWxYXDQMyed4yy5Pgrs3n92FR.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\"> Bound</a>\r\n      <p>Smart.

A great one will know that's not\r\n                    enough.  You have to come up with a plot that seems perfect, and then have it go wrong in ways you don't expect.\r\n                    \"Bound\" fits into the latter category.  That it has time for strong writing and acting makes it something of a\r\n                    miracle.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                \r\n                    <img id=\"violetAndCorky\" src=\"https://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/bound-1996/homepage_EB19961004REVIEWS610040302AR.jpg\" alt=\"Violet and Corky\">\r\n                    <p>Corky (Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who has just moved into a condo next to a sultry, raven-haired beauty\r\n                    named Violet (Tilly).  Violet's lover is Caesar (Pantoliano), who launders money for the local mob.  But Violet\r\n                    is unhappy, both sexually and personally, and when she sees Corky in the elevator, she sees hope for a way out.\r\n                    It just so happens that a local mob flunkie tried to abscond with $2 million plus, and the punishment ended up\r\n                    being a bloody mess.  Caesar has been tasked with (literally) laundering the money.  And there in lies an opportunity\r\n                    for Corky and Violet to get away with the money and leave the weasel Caesar to take the fall for it.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>From an execution perspective, \"Bound\" is a near-brilliant piece of film noir.  Corky's plan is ingenious, but\r\n                    that's just the set-up.  Caesar is smart, and acts in ways that neither Corky nor Violet anticipate, which leads to\r\n                    a lot of tense moments and improvising.  There were plenty of times where I had no idea what to expect.  Other times\r\n                    I thought I knew what was going to happen but was proven wrong.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                    <img src=\"https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Wkyf2OXT_6TRQbrUgACAxwHaFj&pid=15.1&P=0&w=227&h=171\" alt=\"violetAndTheMoney\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>On a technical level, the film matches its plot.  The Wachowski sisters, who at the time were still male, have a sense of\r\n                    visual flair (as they proved with their most famous, and successful, franchise, The Matrix\"). They know that camera movement\r\n                    and plot rhythm are essential in a movie like this, and some of their shots are stunning.  The majority of the film takes place\r\n                    in two apartments, but they make this film into a claustrophobic yet still kinetic experience.  The sisters start out slow and\r\n                    allow the tension to build.  Far too many thrillers lack that confidence.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>For this movie to work, the actors have to sell their characters, and they do.  Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon, both of whom\r\n                    deserve far more fame than they get, are excellent in their roles.  Tilly with her helium voice flouts the dim-bulb girlfriend that\r\n                    Violet initially appears to be.  When she seduces Corky with enough speed and elegance to surprise us, we know that she's a force\r\n                    to be reckoned with.  For her part, Gershon also escapes the stereotype that she starts out as.  Corky may be a bad to the bone butch\r\n                    lesbian, but she's also smart and clever.  The two women have a lot of chemistry with each other, so much so that their sex scene is red hot,\r\n                    despite the fact that it happens only a few minutes after their first interaction together.  Able support is provided by veteran character\r\n                    actor Joe Pantoliano (whom the Wachowskis would infamously cast in \"The Matrix\") and Christopher Meloni.  Meloni, best known for playing\r\n                    Det. Elliot Stabler on \"Law and Order: SVU,\" is an interesting case.  He's quite good as the psychotic son of the Don.  His background\r\n                    is mainly in comedy, and he has little trouble tweaking it for a menacing effect.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>One thing I appreciated is that even in 1996, the Wachowski sisters refuse to make the fact that the two lead characters are lesbians\r\n                    into any sort of a big deal.  Many films that deal with LGBT characters, even the better ones, feel as if they have to comment on it or \r\n                    justify it in some sense.  Not here.  THat they are lesbians simply makes them stick out in our minds more.  Make Corky (or even Violet...\r\n                    which would be interesting in its own right) a man and almost nothing would change.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>Heist movies and film noir are not uncommon territory for the movies.  Movies that combine both in such a spectacular fashion are.  And\r\n                    that's why I highly recommend \"Bound.\"</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div></div></div></div></body>\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--The Devil's Own box-->\r\n      <a onclick=\"toggle('DBZ');\"> <img class=\"moviePoster\" alt=\"Move Poster\" src=\"https://fanart.tv/fanart/movies/4477/movieposter/the-devils-own-5229d98bbd6a9.jpg\"> The Devil's Own</a>\r\n      <p>A solid thriller, but could (and should) have been a lot more.</p>\r\n      <div id=\"TDO\" style=\"z-index: 0; display:none\">\r\n            <div class=\"review\">\r\n                    <h1>The Devil's Own</h1>\r\n                    <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://fanart.tv/fanart/movies/4477/movieposter/the-devils-own-5229d98bbd6a9.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">\r\n                    <p>Rating: THREE OUT OF FOUR</p>\r\n                    <p>Starring: Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, Ruben Blades, Treat Williams, Natasha McElhone,\r\n                        Margaret Colin, Paul Ronan</p>\r\n                    <p>Rated R for Strong Brutal Violence, and for Language</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <!--Review-->\r\n                    <div id=\"quote\">\r\n                    <p>Don't expect a happy ending.

Wanted for dozens of\r\n                    murders, Frankie barely escapes with his life after the British try to take him down (killing a number of\r\n                    his friends in the process).  Frankie is sent to the US to pick up some stinger missiles, believing that to\r\n                    be the only way of getting the British government's attention.  Now known as Rory Devaney, he is staying at\r\n                    the home of an IRA sympathizer's friend, a cop named Tom O'Meara (Ford).  But the past doesn't stay buried\r\n                    forever, and Frankie's true purpose for being in New York is bound to catch up with him.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>Despite all its problems, the film is strongly acted.  Ford and Pitt, two consistently good actors, do solid\r\n                    work.  It's not Oscar-worthy material from either of them, but they do their jobs.  Ford is his usual reliable self\r\n                    playing a good, moral cop facing a number of difficult choices.  Pitt manages to get us on his side despite the fact\r\n                    he is a terrorist capable of brutal acts of violence.  Ruben Blades provides solid support as Tom's partner, although\r\n                    his story is almost superfluous (it's meant to give the film color and allow the audience to understand Tom's motivations\r\n                    for the final act, but it doesn't really work).  Treat Williams turns up the nasty as a gunrunner, and Natasha McElhone\r\n                    is good as Frankie's contact/love interest.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"communion\" src=\"https://www.hotflick.net/flicks/1997_The_Devil_s_Own/997TDO_Julia_Stiles_003.jpg\" alt=\"Communion\">\r\n                    <p>This was the final film of Alan J. Pakula, a director of some repute (he was killed in a car accident shortly after the\r\n                    film was finished).  It's solidly told, but there are a few concerns I have about the film.  First the film makes no mention\r\n                    of the Troubles.  The backdrop is generic; substitute any conflict in its place and almost nothing would change.  Not only\r\n                    is this a little insulting to those who were affected by the conflict, it robs the film of a lot of texture and possible conflict.\r\n                    Second, Pakula uses a light jaunty tune over a montage of Frankie and his friend Sean (Ronan) preparing their boat to take the\r\n                    missiles back to Ireland.  It's a little disconcerting, especially after 9/11.  Finally, the film is a little too violent for its own\r\n                    good.  With a darker tone and more weight to the script (apparently this was the case for the original script that Pitt signed on to make,\r\n                    but rewrites diluted it), the brutality would have been appropriate.  As it is, it comes across as excessive.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>Watching this movie, I couldn't help wishing it was more.  With a stronger, richer script and characters who exhibited more\r\n                    dimensions, this could have been the film it deserved to be.  It raises a lot of interesting questions.  Questions like, is terrorism ever\r\n                    justified (which \"Munich\" asked nearly a decade later)?  How does witnessing or committing acts of violence affect a person?  How\r\n                    does the act of arresting or possibly killing a man affect you if you know and love the person?  Compelling questions to be sure,\r\n                    but unfortunately there's no follow through.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>If you're looking for a good thriller, this is an okay choice.  I liked it.  I was entertained.  But I kept seeing the film that it\r\n                    could have been.

One has to admire director Lee Tamahori's\r\n                        guts for not flinching when it comes to depicting the horrors of domestic violence.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"bethAndJake\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.backseatmafia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Once-Were-Warriors.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080\" alt=\"Beth and Jake\">\r\n                    <p>On the surface, the Heke family seems to be normal and happy.  But take one peek beneath the \"Kodak moment,\" and you'll\r\n                    find that they are anything but.  The father, Jake (Morrison), is a desperate alcoholic and prone to extreme violence\r\n                    against anyone unfortunate enough to cross him.  His wife, Beth (Owen), takes the brunt of it, although by no means is she\r\n                    the only victim.  Her oldest son, Nig (Arahanga) has joined a gang, her daughter Grace (Kerr-Bell) has sought refuge living\r\n                    with a friend in a burned out car, and younger son Boogie (Emile) is constantly in trouble with the law.  But when a brutal,\r\n                    drunken beating leaves Beth unable to attend a court hearing for Boogie, she's had enough.  She puts her foot down, and the\r\n                    results are not pretty.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"argument\" src=\"https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1408142219/002/10391002_600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Argument\">\r\n                    <p>Probably the most noticable reason why this film is so powerful is that the performances by the two leads are nothing short\r\n                    of astounding.  Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison aren't merely good, they're superb.  You've never seen acting like this before.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>Rena Owen garnered a number of awards for her fearless portrayal of a woman who finds the strength to stand up to her husband,\r\n                    and rightly so.  Owen is miraculous, playing Beth as a tough yet loving wife and mother.  She loves her husband dearly, but his\r\n                    abuse is no longer something she can accept.  As Jake, Temuera Morrison is brilliant as a man held hostage by his temper and his\r\n                    addiction.  Although he is a brutal, drunken thug, there is a kernel of humanity that is desperate to regain control of himself.\r\n                    The kids are solid, but this is really their show.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"bloodyBeth\" src=\"https://trailersfromhell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5206c.jpg\" alt=\"Bloody Beth\">\r\n                    <p>Ironically, the only one who got a career boost from this movie was director Lee Tamahori, although it wasn't for the best.\r\n                    Tamahori has since become a director of mediocre to awful action movies.  Examples of his work are \"The Edge,\" an unbelievably\r\n                    lame adventure movie, and \"Die Another Day,\" which caused the James Bond franchise to go into turnaround until it was rebooted\r\n                    four years later.  One wonders why he doesn't take the hint and go back to making gritty dramas like this (although he did make\r\n                    a biopic of Uday Hussein, but that doesn't really speak much to his talent).  Probably because the money is too good to turn down.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>Nevertheless, the man's work here is a revelation.  Tamahori never flinches, even when it comes to the film's most disturbing scenes.\r\n                    He doesn't sugarcoat anything and he is never coy.  You have to admire a director who is willing (and able) to take his audience\r\n                    this far into a story that is so punishing.  He also has a gift for directing actors, as anyone who watches this movie can plainly see.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>While this film is extraordinariliy successful in its exploration of the issues of domestic violence and alcoholism, Tamahori's attempts to put it into a wider context fall short.  The director attempts to address the hardships that Maoris face in modern day\r\n                    society, but the are unsuccessfuly presented, and for someone who isn't looking for them, easily missed.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p>Whatever flaws the film may have, they are certainly not enough to make me think twice about recommending this film.  On the contrary,\r\n                    I enthusiastically encourage people to watch it.  It is tough medicine to be sure, but worth it in the end.  The story is extraordinarily\r\n                    powerful, and the acting by Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison is the stuff of legends.  You don't see many movies that have this kind of impact\r\n                    on a viewer.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Frailty-->\r\n      <a onclick=\"toggle('Frailty');\" img=\"\" class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/f1/f3/63f1f3ab615eb90cf7d015e13ebaae48.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\"> Frailty</a>\r\n      <p>Psychological horror at its most potent.</p>\r\n      <div id=\"Frailty\" style=\"z-index: 0; display:none\">\r\n            <div class=\"review\">\r\n                    <h1>Frailty</h1>\r\n                    <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/f1/f3/63f1f3ab615eb90cf7d015e13ebaae48.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">\r\n                    <p>Rating: THREE-AND-A-HALF OUT OF FOUR</p>\r\n                    <p>Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Matt O'Leary, Jeremy Sumpter, Powers Boothe</p>\r\n                    <p>Rated R for Violence and Some Language</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <!--Review-->\r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to go on the American Family Association's Facebook page and get into spirited debates\r\n                    about certain issues.  Usually regarding Target's policy of allowing transpeople to use the bathroom that they identify\r\n                    with, although they support any right-wing cause.  As hilarious as the banter sometimes gets, it's also very scary.  The\r\n                    blind faith of some of these individuals in the face of logic or the realitites of our legal system, or even the hypocrisy\r\n                    that they are unable to see is quite unsettling.  Traits like that from religion can take people down a very dark path.\r\n                    \"Frailty\" is about one such individual.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>A man named Fenton Meiks (McConaughey) has arrived at the office of FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (Boothe).  Doyle is heading the\r\n                    investigation into the notorious God's Hand serial killer, and Fenton claims that the killer is his brother Adam.  To explain\r\n                    how he knows this, Fenton tells a disturbing story.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"dinner\" src=\"https://zuts.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/frailty-family-table.jpg\" alt=\"dinner\">\r\n                    <p>In the summer of 1979, Fenton (O'Leary) grew up in small town Texas with his father (Paxton) and younger brother Adam (Sumpter).\r\n                    Their mother died giving birth to Adam and they have no other surviving relatives, but they get by.  Dad loves his sons more than\r\n                    anything and they love and respect him in turn.  One night, Dad wakes them up, claiming that he was visited by an angel who tasked\r\n                    them with destroying demons that take human form.  Adam is enthusiastic but Fenton is incredulous.  It's too difficult to swallow.\r\n                    Fenton believes that this is all a nightmare that will pass, but then Dad brings home the first body.  More will follow, and Fenton\r\n                    has to find a way to stop the bloodshed.  But that means convincing Adam, and worse, confronting his father.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>\"Frailty\" was marketed as some sort of supernatural slasher movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Physically, this isn't\r\n                    a violent movie.  Most of the violence occurs off screen, and there's very little gore.  Psychologically, well, that's a different story.\r\n                    Watching a young boy face the reality that his father has become a delusional killer is a brutal blow to the psyche.  Even worse, he has\r\n                    a younger brother who is too easily manipulated.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"dadAndOtis\" src=\"https://houseofmirthandmovies.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/horror_decade_frailty1.jpg\" alt=\"Dad and Otis\">\r\n                    <p>Paxton's character is not a traditional villain, and that's what makes this film so disturbing.  He's kind, loving and affectionate\r\n                    towards his children.  In all other respects, he's a good man.  But his delusions, if they are that, have turned this gentle soul into\r\n                    a murderous zealot.  It would be difficult for anyone to accept, much less live through.  To ask that of a pre-teen is heartbreaking.\r\n                    How would you react?  It would be hard enough if it was your neighbor or a psychopath down the street, but that it is his father, whom\r\n                    he loves dearly, makes things much more complicated.  It would havea been too easy for Paxton to take the easy road and make a slasher\r\n                    film, but he goes the extra mile.  He makes this about the situation, and the toll it takes on his children.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>The performances are strong  across the board.  Matthew McConaughey lends his low-key personality to the story, ably portraying a man\r\n                    who is dealing with a lifetime of guilt.  Powers Boothe appears in what is essentially a plot device, but his character is meant to be\r\n                    a plot device and nothing more.  He serves his purpose and that's all that's required of him.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"murderInTheBasement\" src=\"https://vareverta.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/frailty2.jpg\" alt=\"Murder in the Basement\">\r\n                    <p>As you might expect, the majority of the film is spent in 1979, with Paxton, O'Leary and Sumpter taking up the majority of screen time.\r\n                    All are effective, but special mention has to go to Matt O'Leary, who is excellent as the morally conflicted, emotionally traumatized Fenton.\r\n                    He has a tremendous burden on his shoulders that no one should have to carry, and the young actor handles the complexities of his role with ease.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>The opening scenes with Fenton and Doyle are a little rough, since they know things we don't ore rely on assumptions that we can't make.  But\r\n                    they're not bad.  The problem is with the ending.  Paxton overplays his hand when it comes to the ambiguity of whether or not any of this is real,\r\n                    but never more so than in the ending, which spells out exactly what happens.  This is necessary for the twist ending to work, but it feels like a\r\n                    cheat.  A more honest approach would have been better.  The writing in these scenes is a little sloppy too, so it's got that going against it as\r\n                    well.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>\"Frailty\" is not for everyone.  It's very disturbing and not for younger viewers.  I imagine that a few people will be turned off by the trauma\r\n                    that these young boys have to go through.  I can understand their sentiments, but Paxton is unrepentant.  He takes no prisoners and makes no\r\n                    concessions.  I applaud him for that.  Had he done so, the film wouldn't have been as effective as it is.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <p>Regardless, if you do see it, you will not forget it.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--I Know What You Did Last Summer-->\r\n      <a onclick=\"toggle('Last Summer')\" ;=\"\" class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/posters/800/I/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer-1997-movie-poster.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\"> I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>\r\n      <p>This slasher flick is great fun!</p>\r\n      <div id=\"Last Summer\" style=\"z-index: 0; display:none\">\r\n            <div class=\"review\">\r\n                    <h1>I Know What You Did Last Summer</h1>\r\n                    <img class=\"moviePoster\" src=\"https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/posters/800/I/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer-1997-movie-poster.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\">\r\n                    <p>Rating: THREE-AND-A-HALF OUT OF FOUR</p>\r\n                    <p>Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Ryan Phillipe, Anne Heche,\r\n                    Brigette Wilson</p>\r\n                    <p>Rated R for Strong Horror Violence and Language</p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <!--Review-->\r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>All throughout my life, there was no movie I was dying to see more than \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\"\r\n                    I was constantly begging my parents to let me see it.

The trailer was awesome, the poster looked suitably mysterious, and let's face it,\r\n                    that's a hell of a great title.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"findingTheBody\" src=\"https://wheresthejump.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-1.jpg\" alt=\"Finding The Body\">\r\n                    <p>It's July in a fishing village on the east coast.  Julie James (Hewitt) is celebrating her friend Helen Shivers (Gellar)\r\n                    being elected the new beauty queen.  They and their boyfriends, rich snob Barry Cox (Phillipe) and local boy\r\n                    Ray Bronson (Prinze Jr.) are out partying on the beach.  On the way home, drunk Barry (who at least has the good sense to let\r\n                    Ray drive...under protest, but there you have it) decides to stand in the sunroof and be an asshole.

But when he screams, \"LOOK OUT!\" it's too late.\r\n                    The car smashes into a man who is now lying crumpled in the middle of the road.

Whodunits are always interesting because they leave you hungering for\r\n                    answers.  The film is based on a story by teen thriller guru Lois Duncan, and it's a good story.  But there's something that Duncan and\r\n                    screen scribe Kevin Williamson (whose script was put into production almost immediately after \"Scream\" became a massive hit) add to the\r\n                    production that beefs up the plot and makes the characters more identifiable.  The story shows, without pretension or needlessly drawing\r\n                    out the story, how trauma and guilt can warp personalities and destroy relationships.  Before the accident, these four were close friends\r\n                    with their own plans and dreams for the future.  After the accident, none of these dreams have been realized and they avoid each other like\r\n                    the plague.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <img id=\"onTheBoat\" src=\"https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/09/i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_a_l.jpg\" alt=\"On the Boat\">\r\n                    <p>The performances help the film a lot.  None of them are crying out for Oscar attention (in fact, they're not especially memorable).  But\r\n                    they do succeed in getting us to identify with these people, and for a thriller to work, that's crucial.  Leading the pack are Jennifer Love\r\n                    Hewitt, who makes Julie into a resourceful yet guil-ridden young woman, and Ryan Phillipe as the conceited boor Barry.  They have their stiff\r\n                    moments, but they are mostly effective.  Less impressive are Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.  Neither one of them has great range,\r\n                    and it shows.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>It's interesting to note that Lois Duncan disliked the movie intensely.  Apart from the premise, almost nothing from her book made it into the\r\n                    film.  She especially hated that the turned her thriller into a slasher movie after her own daughter was murdered in 1989 (still unsolved).  The\r\n                    latter aspect is actually the film's problem.  Kevin Williamson has changed the story's genre (not excatly a rare occurrance) in a way that is not\r\n                    particularly successful.  The story and the characters are strong enough that gratuitous violence and chase sequences are unnecessary (although it's\r\n                    not as violent and gory as some other members of the genre).</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                \r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p>Not that that hurts the film too much.  It's put together with skill by Jim Gillespie (whose later films were not particularly successful, making \r\n                    me think that the lion's share of the credit has to go to Williamson, and to a lesser extent, Duncan) and is consistently suspenseful and scary.  The\r\n                    final scene is a tease, but still, where else can you find a whodunit where the heroine actually knows the killer's motives before she knows who the\r\n                    killer is?</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"box\">\r\n      <!--Coming Soon-->\r\n      <h1>Coming Soon</h1>\r\n      <p>Confession</p>\r\n      <p>The War Zone</p>\r\n      <p>Saving Private Ryan</p>\r\n      <p>Black Book</p>\r\n      <p>Old Review Site: <a href=\"http://www.mikesmovietips.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike's Movie Tips</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  \r\n\r\n</html>\r\n"},"hash":"38bf86e6e7967e028d84141924ee1eaf","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
