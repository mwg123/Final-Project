I love it with all my heart.  \"Spirited Away,\"\r\n    written and directed by master storyteller Hayao Miyazaki, is a true\r\n    masterpiece.  Not only is it the finest animated film ever made, it is\r\n    one of the finest animated films ever made period.  It deserves a place\r\n    alongside \"The Godfather,\" \"Schindler's List,\" and \"Casablanca.\"  Visually\r\n    dazzling, emotionally complex and splendidly told, this is truly a movie for\r\n    all to enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"bathhouse\" src=\"https://wardrobejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/spirited_away_screenshot_3_by_anian0-d4epnpx.jpg\" alt=\"The Bathhouse\">\r\n\r\n    <p>Chihiro (Chase) is a whiny brat who is upset that she's having to move to\r\n    the middle of nowhere with her parents (voiced by Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis).\r\n    On the way there, they get sidetracked and end up in an abandoned theme park...or so\r\n    they think.  Chihiro's parents begin to chow down on delicious food (that they'll pay\r\n    for later), but they end up turning into pigs.  Now Chihiro is trapped in the world of\r\n    the gods and forced to work in a bathouse run by the vicious Yubaba (Pleshette).  Her\r\n    allies are few, and she has to remember who she is if she is to rescue her parents\r\n    return to our world.</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"landscape\" src=\"http://fanaru.com/spirited-away/image/116169-spirited-away-travel-scene.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape\">\r\n\r\n    <p>The first thing one notices about a Miyazaki film is the vivid and colorful images.\r\n    All his films are wildly imaginative, but none moreso than \"Spirited Away.\"  This is a\r\n    truly beautiful film that would be worth watching on mute.  Miyazaki fills the screen with\r\n    wonderful and bizarre creatures that capture the eye as well as the mind.  From the three\r\n    bouncing heads in Yubaba's office to the mysterious Noh-Face that lurks in the background,\r\n    there is never a dull moment for they eyes.  In fact, this whole world, particularly the \r\n    bathhouse, begs \"Explore Me!\"</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"chihiroAndGold\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.iamag.co/features/itsart/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Spirited-Away-4.jpg?w=371&h=232&crop\" alt=\"Chihiro and Gold\">\r\n\r\n    <p>The second thing one notices is the complexity of the story.  Disney movies, even the\r\n    best ones, are constrained by formulas.  That doesn't happen here.  There's no telling\r\n    where this story is going to go.  Miyazaki carefully lets it unfold as Chihiro sees it.\r\n    We don't know any more about this strange place than she does.  The story also plays by\r\n    different rules than most American films.  The themes of identity and transformation\r\n    (people are rarely who they seem, in a both literal and figurative sense) are, as told by\r\n    Miyazaki, different than what we're used to.  Yet, at its heart, this is really a coming of\r\n    age story.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The voice acting is fantastic.  Daveigh Chase is terrific as Chihiro.  This is a girl we\r\n    can all get behind and root for.  Chase, who famously played Samara in \"The Ring,\" has a\r\n    tendency to get shrill when she screams, but those moments are few.  Jason Marsden, a popular\r\n    Disney voice actor, is positively perfect as Haku, the mysterious boy who may or may not be\r\n    helping Chihiro.  His voice is soothing and seductive, and Miyazaki draws him in such a way\r\n    that is both threatening and romantic.  Susan Egan, also a good voice actress, is terrific as\r\n    Lin, Chihiro's feisty freind.  The late great Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film appearance) \r\n    is suitably menacing as the boss who controlls her workers by stealing their names.  At the very\r\n    least, no one can claim that Yubaba isn't an original villain.  And yet, Pleshette gives the character\r\n    some humanity, mainly by having her dote on her giant baby (Strong).</p>\r\n\r\n    <img id=\"yubaba\" src=\"https://sweensryche.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/chihiro-yubaba-spirited-away-399712_953_516.jpg\" alt=\"Yubaba\">\r\n\r\n    <p>While Kirk Wise may have directed the English speaking voice actors (and added a few lines), this is\r\n    all Miyazaki.  It has all his trademarks: vivid images, characters that touch the heart and a strong\r\n    storytelling ability.  But more important is the feel of the film.  Miyazaki is a master of tone; all his\r\n    films have a sense of magical whimsy that only he can create.  The wonderful musical score by Joe Hisaishi\r\n    (who always scores Miyazaki's films), is beautiful and evocative without feeling overly manipulative.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\"Spirited Away\" is a true masterpiece and while it achieved immense critical and overseas success (it\r\n    outgroosed \"Titanic\" to become the highest grossing film in Japanese history), it's still a cult movie in \r\n    many respects.  That's a shame, because anyone who watches it will see it for what it is: a one of a kind\r\n    moviegoing experience.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"hash":"288582c32da8021990486d2bbdb7540c","cacheData":{}}
