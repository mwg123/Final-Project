    <p>I remember seeing a few bits of "Dragonball Z" on TV growing up and thinking
    it was extremely stupid.  So why did I spend more money than usual to see a 
    spin-off movie of the show in the theater?  I'm not sure, really.  A chance to
    dish out some bile? Or perhaps to see if, now that I've seen some good anime (like "Inuyasha" or anything)
    by Hayao Miyazaki, it wasn't as bad as I remember (the latter is why I subjected myself
    to watching "The Royal Tenenbaums" a second time).  If nothing else, it could give me another entry for 
    my Bottom 10 list this year.</p>

    <p>So what's the verdict?  Look at the rating and take a guess.</p>

    <p>"Dragonball Z: Resurrection "F" is for fans only.  Anyone who hasn't grown to love
    the characters while watching the show will find little of any interest here.  Granted,
    "Inuyasha: Affections Touching Across Time" wasn't the most friendly to people who weren't
    already fans of the show, but it at least gave a perfunctory set-up.  That doesn't happen
    here, where there is no set-up or character development whatsoever.</p>
